Your task is to create a shell that handles basic navigation, file manipulation, and process control—faithfully mimicking essential shell behaviors without relying on existing shell utilities.\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\n- Work with **file and directory operations**\n- Manage **user input and output** within a shell loop\n- Implement **robust error handling**\n- Gain experience in **Unix process and system call APIs**\n\n### Core Requirements\n\nYour minimalist shell must:\n\n- Display a prompt (`$ `) and wait for user input\n- Parse and execute user commands\n- Return to the prompt only after command execution completes\n- Handle `Ctrl+D` (EOF) gracefully to exit the shell\n\nYou must implement the following commands **from scratch**, using system-level Rust abstractions:\n\n- `echo`\n- `cd`\n- `ls` (supporting `-l`, `-a`, `-F`)\n- `pwd`\n- `cat`\n- `cp`\n- `rm` (supporting `-r`)\n- `mv`\n- `mkdir`\n- `exit`\n\nAdditional constraints:\n\n- Do **not** use any external binaries or system calls that spawn them\n- If a command is unrecognized, print:  \n  `Command '<name>' not found`\n\n### Constraints\n\n- Only basic command syntax is required  \n  (No piping `|`, no redirection `>`, no globbing `*`, etc.)\n- Shell behavior should align with Unix conventions\n- Code must follow [good coding practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/)\n\n### Bonus Features\n\nImplementing any of the following will be considered bonus:\n\n- Handle `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) without crashing the shell\n- Shell usability enhancements:\n  - **Auto-completion**\n  - **Command history**\n  - **Prompt with current directory** (e.g., `~/projects/0-shell $`)\n  - **Colorized output** for commands, directories, and errors\n  - **Command chaining** with `;`\n  - **Pipes** (`|`)\n  - **I/O redirection** (`>`, `<`)\n- Support for environment variables (e.g. `$HOME`, `$PATH`)\n- A custom `help` command documenting built-in functionality\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```shell\nstudent$ ./0-shell\n$ cd dev\n$ pwd\n/dev\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\ncrw-------  1 root   root     10,    58 Feb  5 09:21 acpi_thermal_rel\ncrw-r--r--  1 root   root     10,   235 Feb  5 09:21 autofs\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root   root           540 Feb  5 09:21 block\n...\n$ something\nCommand 'something' not found\n$ echo \"Hello There\"\nHello There\n$ exit\nstudent$\n```\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\n\nThis project will be reviewed and graded based on the following:\n\n- **Functionality**: Commands perform correctly and emulate standard Unix behavior\n- **Stability**: Shell handles user errors, invalid input, and edge cases without crashing\n\n### Resources\n\n- [man pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/) (e.g., `man 2 open`, `man 2 execve`)\n- [Unix Shell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)\n- [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/)\n- [Rust std::fs and std::process Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)\n",

You will not be asked to create\na project from scratch, instead you will have **to add features or fix the code of a given application**.\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou will be provided with an ATM management system where users can do the following actions:\n\n- Login/Register\n- Create a new account\n- Check the details of existing accounts\n- Update information of existing accounts\n- Remove existing accounts\n- Check list of owned accounts\n- Make transactions\n\n> The application provided will just handle the **login**, the **creation of new accounts** and **checking the list of owned accounts** but you can optimise and refactor the code. The rest of the features must\n> be implemented by yourself.\n\n### File System\n\nA folder which you can find [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/atm-system/atm-system.zip) is provided, this folder will have the following `fs`(file system):\n\n```console\n.\n|\n├── data\n│   ├── records.txt\n│   └── users.txt\n├── Makefile\n└── src\n    ├── auth.c\n    ├── header.h\n    ├── main.c\n    └── system.c\n```\n\nThe `data` folder presented above will contain information about the users and their accounts:\n\n- `users.txt` will be the file that stores all information about each user\n- `records.txt` will be the file that stores all information relevant to the accounts for each user\n\nThe format of the content saved in the file will be displayed like this :\n\n`users.txt` (id, name, password):\n\n```console\n0 Alice 1234password\n1 Michel password1234\n....\n```\n\n`records.txt` (id, user_id, user name, account id, date of creation, country, phone nº, balance, type of account) :\n\n```console\n0 0 Alice 0 10/02/2020 german 986134231 11090830.00 current\n1 1 Michel 2 10/10/2021 portugal 914134431 1920.42 savings\n2 0 Alice 1 10/10/2000 finland 986134231 1234.21 savings\n....\n```\n\n### Features\n\nThe following features must be implemented by yourself.\n\n1. The **Registration** feature, you must be able to register new users, users with the same name can not exist (names must be unique). They must be saved in the right file.\n\n2. The **Update information of existing account** feature, users must be able to update their country or phone number.\n\n   2.1. You must ask users to input the account `id` they want to change, followed by a prompt asking which field they want to also change (the only fields that are permitted to update is the phone number and the country).\n\n   2.2. Whenever users update an account, it must be saved into the corresponding file.\n\n3. The **Checking the details of existing accounts** feature, users must be able to check just one account at a time.\n\n   3.1. For this they must be asked to input the account id they want to see\n\n   3.2. If the account is either `savings`, `fixed01`, `fixed02` and `fixed03` the system will display\n   the information of that account and the interest you will acquire depending on the account:\n\n   - savings: interest rate 7%\n   - fixed01(1 year account): interest rate 4%\n   - fixed02(2 year account): interest rate 5%\n   - fixed03(3 year account): interest rate 8%\n   - If the account is current you must display `You will not get interests because the account is of type current`\n\n   For example: for an account of type `savings` with a deposit date of `10/10/2002` and an amount of `$1023.20` the system will show `\"You will get $5.97 as interest on day 10 of every month\"`.\n\n4. The **Make transaction** feature, users must be able to create transactions, withdrawing or depositing money to a certain account. All transactions\n   must be updated and saved into the corresponding file. Accounts of type `fixed01`, `fixed02` and `fixed03` are not allowed to make transactions and an error message should be displayed if transactions are attempted with these accounts.\n\n5. The **Remove existing account** feature, users must be able to delete their own account, the same must happen here, updates must be saved into the corresponding file.\n\n6. The **Transfer owner** feature, users can transfer their account to another user, by:\n\n   6.1. Identifying the account and the user they want to transfer the ownership to\n\n   6.2. Saving the information in the corresponding file\n\n### Bonus\n\nAs a bonus you can add a verification to the field **Transfer owner**. Every time a user transfers ownership of an account the other user who received the account\ncan be alerted that he or she received an account from someone instantly.\nExample: if you have two terminals opened logged in with two different users, and one sends the account to the other user,\nthe user who received the account should be instantly notified.\nOne of the ways of doing this is by using pipes and child processes (communication between processes).\n\nYou can also do more bonus features or update the terminal interface:\n\n- Better terminal interface (TUI)\n- Encryption of passwords\n- Adding your own Makefile\n\nA relational database can also be added as a bonus. You can use the database of your choice, but we recommend you use SQLite.\nTo know more about SQLite you can check the [SQLite page](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).\n\n### Example\n\nYou can find an example of the final application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVtikDcGG2E). Don't forget that you are free to\nimplement whichever kind of interface you desire. It just needs to obey the instructions given above so it can pass the audit.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) language\n  - Language Fundamentals\n- Data manipulation\n  - File manipulation\n  - Data structures\n- Makefile\n- Terminal UI\n- Memory management\n- Pipes and child processes\n",

Relax, is not that hard, it is only a multiplayer version of it. Ah and forgot to mention that you will need to do it using the framework you created a while ago. Let me explain.\n\n### Objectives\n\nFor this project you have to create a bomberman alike game, where multiple players can join in and battle until one of them is the last man standing.\n\n### Instructions\n\nIn the beginning there are 4 players, and only one came out alive. Each player will have to start in the different corners of the map and only one will be victorious.\n\nYou will have to follow more or less the same principles of [make-your-game](../make-your-game/README.md) project. But we will refresh one of the concepts you will have to respect and deal with:\n\n- [**Performance**](../good-practices/README.md), is one of the most important aspects while developing a game, so let's respect it.\\\n   Just like make-your-game you will have to respect the policy of:\n\n  - Running the game at least at **60fps** at all time\n  - No frame drops\n  - Proper use of [**`requestAnimationFrame`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)\n  - Measuring performance to know if your code is fast\n\nYou must not use canvas, neither [Web-GL](https://get.webgl.org/) nor another framework. For this project you will use the framework you did on the [mini-framework](../mini-framework/) project.\n\nYou will also have to make a chat that enables the different players to talk to each other. You will have to use [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). This chat **can be considered as a \"Hello World\" of the multiplayer feature** for the **bomberman-dom**.\n\n#### Game Mechanics\n\n1. Players\n\n   1. Nº of players: 2 - 4\n   2. Each player must have 3 lives. Then you are out!!\n\n2. Map\n\n   1. The map should be fixed so that every player sees the whole map.\n   2. There will be two types of blocks, the ones that can be destroyed (blocks) and the ones that can not (walls).\n      1. The walls will always be placed in the same place, while the blocks are meant to be generated randomly on the map. Tip: the optional project [different maps](../make-your-game/different-maps/README.md) can be useful for this part.\n      2. In the starting positions the players need to be able to survive. For example: if the players place a bomb, they will need to have space to avoid the bomb explosion.\n   3. The players should be placed in the corners as their starting positions.\n\n3. Power ups (each time a player destroys a block, a random power up may or may not appear):\n\n   1. Bombs: Increases the amount of bombs dropped at a time by 1;\n   2. Flames: Increases explosion range from the bomb in four directions by 1 block;\n   3. Speed: Increases movement speed;\n\nWhen the user opens the game, he/she should be presented to a page where he/she should enter a **nickname** to differentiate users. After selecting a nickname the user should be presented to a waiting page with a **player counter** that ends at 4. Once a user joins, the player counter will increment by 1.\n\nIf there are more than 2 players in the counter and it does not reach 4 players before 20 seconds, a 10 second timer starts, to players get ready to start the game.\\\nIf there are 4 players in the counter before 20 seconds, the 10 seconds timer starts and the game starts.\n\n#### Bonus\n\nAlthough this bomberman already is super cool, it can be always better. Here are some ideas you can implement into the game to make it super awesomely cool:\n\n- **Solo + Co-Op mode**: You are supposed to develop an AI to play against the players. So once the AI is defeated all players involved win.\n- **More power ups**:\n  - _Bomb Push_: Ability to throw a bomb after it has been placed;\n  - _Bomb Pass_: Ability to pass through bombs;\n  - _Block Pass_: Ability to pass through blocks (not walls);\n  - _Detonator_: Ability to choose when a bomb will explode on a key press;\n  - _1 Up_: Gives the player an extra life;\n- **Release power ups after death**: When a player dies it drops one of it's power ups. If the player had no power ups, it drops a random power up.\n- **Team mode**: Make games with 2v2 (two players versus two players).\n- **After death interaction**: When a player dies, they can reappear as a ghost. If a ghost touches another player they come back to life. If a ghost is caught in a bomb explosion, the player controlling the ghost dies permanently.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)\n- [Event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)\n- FPS\n- [Animation performance and frame rate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Animation_performance_and_frame_rate)\n- webSockets\n- Synchronization\n- Developer Tools\n  - [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)\n  - [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)\n",

You will also get extra points based on the next two rolls.\n- `Spare`: On the second frame you knock all the pins left. You move to the next frame as you would normally but you will get extra points based on the next roll.\n\nLast frame scenario:\n\n- If on the 10th frame you make a `Strike` you will get two extra rolls (2 fill balls).\n- If on the 10th frame you make a `Spare` you will get one extra roll (1 fill ball).\n\n#### The scoring system\n\n- Each pin knocked down is one point.\n- If you do a strike (knocking down all 10 pins with the first roll of a frame) it will count as 10 points + the number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls.\n- If you do a spare (knocking down 10 pins in total between the two rolls of a frame) it will count as 10 points + the number of pins knocked down in the next roll.\n\nLast frame scenario:\n\nThe purpose of the filling balls is solely to allow the calculation of the 10th frame. For example if you score a strike in the 10th frame and then you score two more strikes, your total score will be 30, as the last two rolls are fill balls.\n\n### Expected Function\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]\npub enum Error {\n    NotEnoughPinsLeft,\n    GameComplete,\n}\n\npub struct BowlingGame {}\n\nimpl BowlingGame {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        todo!();\n    }\n\n    pub fn roll(&mut self, pins: u32) -> Result<(), Error> {\n        todo!();\n    }\n\n    pub fn score(&self) -> Option<u32> {\n        todo!();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a possible program to test your function,\n\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), Error> {\n    let mut game = BowlingGame::new();\n    game.roll(0)?; // frame 1\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 1: spare\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 2: strike\n    game.roll(5)?; // frame 3\n    game.roll(5)?; // frame 3: spare\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 4: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 5: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 6: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 7: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 8: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 9: strike\n    game.roll(10)?; // frame 10: strike\n    game.roll(2)?; // fill ball 1\n    game.roll(8)?; // fill ball 2\n    println!(\"{:?}\", game.score());\n\n    let mut perfect_game = BowlingGame::new();\n    for _ in 0..12 {\n        perfect_game.roll(10)?;\n    }\n    println!(\"{:?}\", perfect_game.score());\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nAnd its output:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\nSome(252)\nSome(300)\n$\n```\n",

It must have the following variants:\n  - `Empty`\n  - `Malformed`: which has a dynamic boxed error as element\n- Implement a `struct` called `ReadErr` which will represent reading errors with a single field called `child_err` of type `Box<dyn Error>`.\n\nThese structures must implement the `Display` trait. They should write `\"Failed to parse todo file\"` and `\"Failed to read todo file\"`, depending on the respective error case.\n\nThese structures should also naturally implement the `Error` trait. We will override its method `source` to manipulate the error source output.\n\n- For the `ReadErr` structure, `child_err` should be returned, wrapped in `Some()`.\n- For the `ParseErr` structure, `None` should be returned if we have no tasks, otherwise, with a parsing malformation, we should just return `self` wrapped in `Some()`.\n\nIn the `lib.rs` file you will have to declare and implement a `TodoList` and a `Task` structure.\n\n- The `Task` structure serves merely to represent and encapsulate the fields of the tasks in the JSON file.\n- The `TodoList` structure will have two fields called `title` and `tasks` as shown below, and an associated **function** called `get_todo` which receives a `&str` and returns a `Result` which will represent either the deserialized and parsed content in a `Self` instance on success, or any error type on failure.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n[json = \"0.12.4\"](https://docs.rs/json/0.12.4/json/)\n\n### Expected Functions\n\nFor `err.rs`\n\n```rust\nuse std::{error::Error, fmt::Display};\n\npub enum ParseErr {\n    // expected public fields\n}\n\nimpl Display for ParseErr {\n}\n\nimpl Error for ParseErr {\n}\n\npub struct ReadErr {\n    // expected public fields\n}\n\nimpl Display for ReadErr {\n}\n\nimpl Error for ReadErr {\n}\n```\n\nFor `lib.rs`\n\n```rust\nmod err;\n\nuse std::error::Error;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]\npub struct Task {\n    pub id: u32,\n    pub description: String,\n    pub level: u32,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]\npub struct TodoList {\n    pub title: String,\n    pub tasks: Vec<Task>,\n}\n\nimpl TodoList {\n    pub fn get_todo(path: &str) -> Result<TodoList, Box<dyn Error>> {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a program to test your function.\n\nYou can create some _todos_ yourself, inside the boxing_todo file in order to test it.

It exists to amuse and challenge programmers.\n\n### Instructions\n\nWrite a `Brainfuck` interpreter program.\n\nThe source code will be given as the first parameter, and will always be valid with fewer than 4096 operations.\n\nYour `Brainfuck` interpreter will consist of an array of 2048 bytes, all initialized to 0, with a pointer to the first byte.\n\nEvery operator consists of a single character:\n\n- `>`: increment the pointer.\n- `<`: decrement the pointer.\n- `+`: increment the pointed byte.\n- `-`: decrement the pointed byte.\n- `.`: print the pointed byte to standard output.\n- `[`: If the byte at the current pointer is 0, skip forward to the command after the matching `]`.\n- `]`: If the byte at the current pointer is not 0, jump back to the command after the matching `[`.\n- Any other character is treated as a comment and ignored.\n\n### Usage\n\n```console\n$ go run . \"++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.\" | cat -e\nHello World!$\n$ go run . \"+++++[>++++[>++++H>+++++i<<-]>>>++\\n<<<<-]>>--------.>+++++.>.\" | cat -e\nHi$\n$ go run . \"++++++++++[>++++++++++>++++++++++>++++++++++<<<-]>---.>--.>-.>++++++++++.\" | cat -e\nabc$\n$ go run .\n$\n```\n",

Then, [set the `style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style#setting_styles) of your `eye-left` to set its background color to \"black\".

      "full_content": "## kept-promise\n\n### Instructions\n\nSometimes, even with the best of intentions, some promises are not kept.\n\nImagine what should happen if a request is made to some API, but the server is offline.\n\nA `Promise` has two possible outcomes. A `Promise` will eventually \"resolve\" to some value, or \"reject\" with some error information.\n\nFor your Javascript code to properly function, you'll need to write your code to handle both `Promise` eventualities (resolve and reject).\n\nCreate an asynchronous function `doubleIt` in a file `broken-promise.js`. The function `doubleIt` will take an asynchronous function as an input. The asynchronous function passed as an argument will return a `Promise` which will resolve to a number.\n\nIf the `Promise` resolves, your `doubleIt` function should double the value before returning it.\n\nIf the `Promise` rejects, your `doubleIt` function should prepend \"`Error: `\" to the error message before returning it.\n\n> Assume that your function will always get a valid input function\n\n### Example\n\nThe following `main.js` can be used to test your function:\n\n```js\nimport doubleIt from './broken-promise.js'\n\nconst asyncFive = async () => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(5))\n\nconst asyncSeven = async () => new Promise((resolve) => resolve(7))\n\nconst asyncReject = async () => new Promise((_, reject) => reject(\"There are no numbers available\"))\n\nconsole.log(await doubleIt(asyncFive))\nconsole.log(await doubleIt(asyncSeven))\nconsole.log(await doubleIt(asyncReject))\n```\n\nThe output should be the following:\n\n```console\n$ node main.js\n10\n14\nError: There are no numbers available\n$\n```\n\n### Hints\n\nYou may be wondering why it is important to handle resolve and reject cases?\n\nImagine if you expect a `Promise` to resolve to a `number`. If the `Promise` rejects, and you try to interpret the value as a `number`, this could cause your program to crash.\n\nIn true Javascript fashion, \"there are many ways to skin a cat\". It is possible to deal with resolved and rejected promises in more than one way.\n\nThere is the `async`/`await` way, which makes use of `try`/`catch`. This functionality is only available inside `async` functions. This method allows you to write \"synchronous\" looking code, which is blocking while the `Promise` is waiting to resolve.\n\nThere is the `then`/`catch` way, which is non-blocking. The rest of the code executes while the `Promise` is waiting to resolve.\n\nSay we have some function, which waits a while before returning a value.\n```js\nconst someFunc = async (delay) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  if (delay > 0) {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(delay)\n    }, delay * 1000)\n  } else {\n    reject(\"Delay must be positive\")\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIf we invoke `someFunc` in the `async`/`await` way:\n```js\nconst asyncAwait = async () => {\n  try {\n    const value = await someFunc(2)\n    // Do something with the value once the Promise resolves\n    console.log(value)\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Do something with the error if the Promise is rejected\n    console.log(error)\n  }\n  console.log(\"End asyncAwait\")\n}\n```\n\nIt will output like this, because the last `console.log` is blocked until the `Promise` is resolved. This is because the `await` keyword is blocking:\n\n```console\n2\nEnd asyncAwait\n```\n\nIf we invoke `someFunc` in the `then`/`catch` way:\n```js\nconst thenCatch = () => {\n  someFunc(4)\n    .then((value) => {\n      // Do something with the value once the Promise resolves\n      console.log(value)\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n      // Do something with the error if the Promise is rejected\n      console.log(error)\n    })\n  console.log(\"End thenCatch\")\n}\n```\n\nIt will output like this, because the last `console.log` is not blocked. The code continues to execute until the `Promise` is resolved:\n```console\nEnd thenCatch\n4\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Introducing asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)\n- [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)\n- [Using promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)\n- [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)\n- [then](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)\n",

This means you will move to positions 2.\n\nPosition: 0  1  2  3  4\nSteps:    2  3  1  1  4\n                ^\n\n// From position 2, you have 1 step, so you will move to position 3.\n\nPosition: 0  1  2  3  4\nSteps:    2  3  1  1  4\n                   ^\n\n// Finally, from position 3, you have 1 step to reach the last index at position 4 confirming that it's possible so the output will be \"True\".\n\nPosition: 0  1  2  3  4\nSteps:    2  3  1  1  4\n                      ^\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a possible program to test your function:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"piscine\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tinput1 := []uint{2, 3, 1, 1, 4}\n\tfmt.Println(piscine.CanJump(input1))\n\n\tinput2 := []uint{3, 2, 1, 0, 4}\n\tfmt.Println(piscine.CanJump(input2))\n\n\tinput3 := []uint{0}\n\tfmt.Println(piscine.CanJump(input3))\n}\n```\n\nAnd its output :\n\n```console\n$ go run .\ntrue\nfalse\ntrue\n$\n```\n",

Like a boss, yes.\nIf that one already sounds scary to you, don't worry, we've got your back ; you'll be provided some assets to complete this task.\n\nThe goal of this raid is to make a carbon copy of this webpage template:\n![](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/carbon-copy/page-template.jpg)\nFeel free to replace (or not, if you're lazy) the text contents by details about you / your company / your organisation / your dog / anything you want to talk about. Just try to approximatively match the same amount of content, so it still looks visually similar to the placeholder version.\n\nThe raid is divided in 3 phases:\n\n- pure HTML structure\n- custom CSS style\n- JS interactions\n\n### Phase 1: HTML only _(mandatory)_\n\nCreate & write the HTML file `index.html` to build the structure of the page.\nFor this phase, we provide you a CSS file (`styles.css`) that you just have to [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) to your `index.html`, meaning you won't need to style anything. However, you can do it from scratch and write yourself the whole CSS if you feel up to it.\n\nNB: Each item of the navbar menu - in the top right corner - has to bring to the corresponding section on click (clicking on \"About\" scrolls to the \"About\" section in the page); take a look at the [`href` anchor use](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.2.3).\n\nHere is a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) of the webpage, showing the HTML tags you have to use:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/page-wireframe.jpg)\n\n### Phase 2: custom CSS _(mandatory)_\n\nFirst of all, let's customize the color atmosphere of the webpage to your own taste: go to the CSS file `styles.css`, & replace the current blue & yellow with 2 new colors of your choice.\n\nNow that the page is mainly built, you have to populate the \"Dashboard\" section with 3 new elements.\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/dashboard-template.jpg)\n\nThose 3 cards have to display respectively one information with:\n\n- a title\n- a subtitle\n- a text paragraph\n\nFor this phase, you'll have to make the whole HTML & CSS by yourself.\n\n### Phase 3: JS interactions _(mandatory & optional)_\n\nIf you made it until here pretty fast, now the fun will begin! You're going to add a bunch of JS interactions to make elements appear / disappear / change in the HTML & CSS by linking a JS [script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) to your `index.html`.\n\n- Change the order of the pictures when clicking on the pictures' section, [toggling](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/the-classlist-api/) the pre-defined class `row-reverse` from the CSS file `styles.css`.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/images-order.gif)\n\n- Option 1: In the Contact section, when clicking on the \"Introduce yourself\" button, get the text typed in the `input` and display it in the middle of the following sentence: \"Nice to meet you _[put here the input data]_ 👋! Thanks for introducing yourself.\" Also, the `<p>`, `<input>` & `<button>` elements have to disappear after the button has been clicked.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/contact-input.gif)\n\n- Option 2: When clicking on a card, open a modal window that will show the whole article ; the modal will be closed either when clicking on a \"Close\" button, or when the \"Escape\" key is pressed.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/modale.gif)\n\n- Option 3: In the modal article, create a widget that allows to change the text alignment ; on click on `left` or `center` buttons, the layout changes to the chosen justification, and the selected option's `font-weight` becomes `bold` whereas the other becomes `light`.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/text-alignment.gif)\n\n- Warrior option: set the `header` text content with a random quote every time the page is loaded, and then every 10 seconds. You can use this marvelous [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) his most inspiring sayings and display them in your own page!\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/01-edu/public/master/subjects/carbon-copy/fetch-quote.gif)\n\n### Notions\n\n- [HTML tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)\n- [CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)\n- [Css flexbox layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) & [Flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) are always useful\n- [Link a JS script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)\n- [`classList` / `toggle`](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/the-classlist-api/)\n- [`getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) or [`querySelector`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector)\n- [`textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)\n- [`style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style)\n- [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener): [`click` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) / [`keydown` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event) / [`load` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event)\n- [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)\n- [`setInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)\n\n### Files\n\nDownload [`carbon-copy.zip`](https://assets.01-edu.org/carbon-copy) to have at your disposal the following files:\n\n- the CSS file `styles.css` containing the pre-styled elements\n- the `images` folder containing the images to display in the webpage\n- the `assets` folder containing the templates & wireframes images of the webpage\n",

The user must be able to use the left button to place control points for Chaikin's algorithm.\n\n- The selected points must be visible on the canvas. You will need to draw a **small** circle surrounding each point.\n\n- If the canvas has control points drawn on it, then pressing `Enter` should start the animation. It should cycle through the steps until reaching the 7th step of `Chaikin's` algorithm. The animation should then restart.\n\n- If the user presses `Enter` before any points have been drawn, then nothing should happen. It should still be possible to draw points. You may optionally choose to display a message to inform the user that they forgot to draw points.\n\n- If the canvas has only one control point, the program must only present that point and not cycle through the steps.\n\n- If the canvas has only two control points, the program must draw a straight line.\n\n- Pressing `Escape` should quit the window.\n\n> You are free to use any library to create and handle windows, rendering, keyboard and mouse events.\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Make it possible to clear the screen, so that the user can select new control points.\n- Make it possible to drag the control points in real time.\n",

Some websites do not offer very appealing propositions to consume their media.\n\nSo your objective for this raid is to create an UI for the [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).\n\nYou must handle at least:\n- Posts: including:\n  - [stories](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#ask-show-and-job-stories)\n  - [jobs](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#ask-show-and-job-stories)\n  - [polls](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#items)\n- [comments](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#items): each comment must have the proper post parent.\n\nPost and comments must be ordered by newest post to oldest.\nYou must not load all posts at once, so that you only load posts once the users need to see more posts. This can be done with the help of [events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).\n\nThe point of the project is to keep users updated, so we'll need to inform our users of changes to the data using [Live Data](https://github.com/HackerNews/API#live-data). Create a section that presents the newest information. You'll need to notify the user at least every 5 seconds, whenever the live data is updated.\n\nCurrently this API does not present a [rate limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting), but that does not mean that you should abuse or overload the API.\n\nBest ways you can avoid rate limiting:\n- optimize your code to eliminate any unnecessary requests\n- usage of a throttling/debouncing function to regulate the number of requests,\n\n### Optional\n\nYou can handle sub-comments for stories, jobs and polls, by implementing nested comments.\n",

C’est ton rôle de chercher et trouver par toi-même ces solutions pour atteindre l’objectif.\n\n- Sois actif. N’attend pas que les choses se fassent pour toi. 42 est un parcours 100% pratique.\n\n- Sois autonome dans ton cursus. N’attend pas que l’on te dise quoi faire.\n\n- Sois collaboratif, autant sur les projets solos que les projets de groupe. Face aux challenges à resoudre, l’échange et le debat sont tes meilleures armes.\n\n- Ne \"crois\" pas. Sois sûr. Techniquement, relationnelement, organisationellement, administrativement.\n\n- Pour être sûr, teste, contrôle.\n\n- N’ai pas peur de te tromper, d’échouer. L’échec est une étape normale vers le succès.\n\n- Teste à nouveau. Collabore davantage pour tester davantage.\n\n- Ose. Le risque est de se tromper. Voir le commandement 12.\n\n- Sois rigoureux dans ton travail.\n\n- Sois investi dans ton cursus : 50 heures par semaine est un minimum. Ta capacité de travail est une valeur. L’école est ouverte 24h/24 et 7j/7.\n\n- Sois régulier dans ton travail. Un jour oui, un jour non, un coup nocturne, un coup diurne... le chaos t’empêche d’avancer.\n\n- Prévois un groupe de travail large et hétérogène pour y trouver facilement des idées neuves et des groupes de projet.\n\n- Pour tes collaborations et ton travail en groupe, privilégie des étudiants qui n’ont pas déjà la solution au problème.\n\n- Sois investi dans ton groupe de projet, et ne le laisse pas faire ton travail à ta place.\n\n- Ton groupe de projet est solidaire, son succès comme son échec est de la responsabilité de tous, et les conflits se règlent en interne.\n\n- Travaille à l’école. Faire du peer-learning, collaborer, cela demande d’être physiquement avec les autres. A distance cela ne fonctionne pas.\n\n- Implique toi dans les évaluations de tes projets. Elles te permettent de prendre du recul.\n\n- Implique toi dans tes évaluations des projets des autres. La qualité de la communauté en dépend.\n\n- Sois juste et teste rigoureusement tes projets comme ceux des autres en évaluation avec tes propres jeux de tests.\n\n- Joue pleinement le jeu de ta scolarité dans l’état d’esprit demandé, fait tous les exercices et projets demandés.\n\n- Ne cherche pas des biais et des failles dans le système. Tu vas fausser ta propre formation et ta valeur sur le marché.\n\n- Ne triche pas intentionellement. C’est amoral, cela contredit le commandement 12, et c’est du temps inutilement passé à ne pas développer tes compétences pour faire croire aux autres que tu sais coder alors que ce n’est pas le cas.\n\n- Ne rends pas un projet que tu ne serais pas capable de reproduire seul à huis clos. Même si c’est parfois involontaire, c’est aussi de la triche.\n\n- C’est pas pour tes parents que tu travailles, ni pour le staff. C’est pour toi.\n\n- Participe à la vie de la communauté, à son épanouissement, et sa qualité en sortie de formation.\n\n- Aide au respect de ces commandements par la communauté.\n\n- Sois bienveillant et empathique vis à vis de tes camarades comme des personnes avec qui tu interagis, échanges, débats.\n\n- N’ai pas peur du monde professionnel.\n\n- Respecte le matériel. Des consignes spécifiques sont données en ce sens.\n\n- Respecte les locaux. Des consignes spécifiques sont données en ce sens.\n\n- Respecte les gens, étudiants, staffs, partenaires, visiteurs.\n\n- Respecte la loi en vigueur dans le pays.\n\n- Respecte les lois et consignes en vigueur liées à la consommation d’alcool.\n\n- Respecte les lois et consignes en vigueur liées à la consommation de tabac, stupéfiants, ou produits assimilés.\n\n- N’hésite pas à interagir avec le staff, pour parler de tes problèmes, pour remonter des problèmes dans le cursus, pour contribuer au cursus.\n\n- Si tu t’interroges ou ne comprends pas nos choix pédagogiques, demande nous. On ne fait généralement rien au hasard.\n\n### Required\n\nYou [clone](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=git+clone) your [fork](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=github+fork) of this [repository](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=git+repository)\nand in it, you must create a file named `turn_in` () in which you write EXACTLY the following sentence ending by a line break.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"600\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2PPQ2iZ.png\">\n</p>\n\n### Submiting your solution\n\nYour work should be commited and pushed in the master branch of your own fork of this repository.\n",

      "full_content": "## Core War\n\n### Introduction\n\nBack in 1984 D. G. Jones had the brilliant idea to create a programming game inspired by how some viruses manage to take over a system and their internal memory.\n\nFrom the very start the game was a great success and a flourishing community added new features and organized tournaments worldwide.\n\nIn this project we will recreate the necessary tools to run a more elaborate version of the game.\n\n### General instructions\n\n- The Virtual Machine and the Assembler can be done in any compiled language.\n- You should only use the standard library of the language you choose.\n- In case you use any external library it must be largely justified and explained (avoid it at any cost).\n- You must not use external libraries to do the parsing part of the Assembler for any reason.\n- The programs should never crash for any reason.\n- The programs should never leak memory for any reason.\n\n### Game dynamics\n\nAt its very core the game consists of having two or more programs (written by the contestants) that will be executed by the Virtual Machine in an arena (a sandbox memory space).\n\nWe will call those programs the \"players\" from now on since they will be the ones playing. Their creators won't have any possibility to interact with them or the arena during the match.\n\nThe player will have a limited set of instructions it could use to change the state of the arena.\nIt can use those instructions to try and corrupt the opponent's memory space, replicate itself or repair damages made by the enemies.\n\nThe winner will be the last player notifying the arena it was alive before the game ends.\n\n#### Structure of the game\n\nThe Virtual Machine is a simplified reproduction of how a CPU works.\nIt will execute the binary code (the players) in the arena in cycles.\n\nAt the start of the game each player will have one process, and this process will be placed at the start of each player memory space (the current position of a process is called program counter, or PC).\n\nEach process will also have a private memory space (the registers) and a carry.\nA carry is a special flag that may be changed by the result of some instructions, it can be used in many clever ways.\n\nThe players will be able to create new processes using specific instructions, it is worth noting though that every instruction takes a certain amount of cycles to be executed, and creating a new process is the most expensive one.\n\n#### End game\n\nThere is a special instruction, called `live` that notifies the VM one player is still healthy and doing well.\n\nEvery once in a while the VM will check which processes executed such instruction and kill all the processes that have not.\nThe processes are kept alive only if they execute at least one `live` instruction between the VM checks.\n\nOnce there is no more active processes the VM stops execution and the last player that notified it was alive is the winner of the match.\n\nThe VM will use some rules to decrease the elapsed time since the last check down to zero, this means the games can never be infinite and all processes will be killed at one point.\n\n### The Assembler\n\nWe don't want to write code in binary, but we don't want the VM to deal with the complexity of parsing high level instructions at execution time.\n\nTo solve this issue we will create an Assembler which will take an assembly code as input and deliver a binary program as output.\n\nYou should follow those specifications:\n\n- If no parameters are passed it will print a help message.\n- The assembler takes a `file.s` as input.\n- It returns a `file.cor` as output.\n- `file.s` is a regular and boring text file.\n- `file.cor` is a binary file, in order to inspect it we suggest you to use command-line tools like `hexdump`.\n- If there is any error in the source file the Assembler should exit with an error code, print a message on `stderr` (the more specific the better) and do not create any `file.cor`.\n- The binary must be written in [big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).\n\n### The Virtual Machine\n\nThe Virtual Machine role is to execute the binary programs (players) provided as `.cor` files (for a maximum of 4 players).\n\nThe VM must handle a `-d [NB_CYCLES]` flag (stating for \"dump\").\nIf the flag is specified the VM will stop execution at `NB_CYCLES` and dump the memory in the arena in hexadecimal, writing 32 bytes per row.\n\nYou should follow those specifications:\n\n- If no parameters are passed it will print a help message.\n- If one of the `.cor` file is corrupted the VM should exit with an error code, print a message on `stderr` and do not execute the programs.\n- At the start of the battle the VM will print a welcome message as the one showed in the example.\n- At the end of the battle the VM will write the winner (if any) as the one showed in the example.\n- The players will be loaded into the arena starting by the first byte and they will be evenly spaced from each other.\n- The last program passed will be the first one executed during the cycle.\n- During a cycle the VM will load the instruction at the current PC and wait N cycles before to execute it (N being the cost of the instruction).\n- Only when executing the instruction the VM will check for the parameters it may have and it will execute it only if the parameters are correct, otherwise it will print an error on `stderr` and continue to execute.\n- If an instruction has incorrect parameters the PC will be moved forward according to the size of the parameters.\n- If the instruction doesn't exist in the instruction set the PC will be moved forward of 1 byte.\n- When a new process is forked it will be placed at the end of the processes and start its execution at the start of the next cycle (which means it will be the first one being executed on the next cycle).\n- The entire execution is deterministic, so with the same inputs you must always have the same outputs.\n- The VM assumes the binary is in big-endian and read it accordingly.\n\nThose are the cases where a file is considered corrupted:\n\n- Wrong signature code.\n- Declared size of the program not matching the actual size.\n- The size of the program is bigger that the maximum allowed size.\n- The total file size is smaller than the minimum size.\n\n### Greeting and end game messages\n\nAt the start of each game the VM should print:\n\n```\nFor this match the players will be:\nPlayer 1 ([X] bytes): [NAME] ([DESCRIPTION])\nPlayer 2 ([X] bytes): [NAME] ([DESCRIPTION])\n...\n```\n\nAt the end of the game the vm should print `cycle [X]: The winner is player [X]: [NAME]!`.\n\n> If nobody executed a valid `live` statement the end message should be `cycle [X]: Nobody wins!`.\n\n#### Circular memory space of the arena\n\nThe memory where the players will fight is circular, this means if we want to move forward from the last address in memory (for example `4095`) we will arrive at address `0`.\n\nIt implies that moving backward of one position from `0` will bring us to the address `4095`.\n\n> Having circular memory guarantees players they will never overflow the memory space they are playing in.\n\n#### Stop process execution\n\nEvery `CYCLE_TO_DIE` the VM will check every process and kill all the processes that did not successfully execute any `live` instruction.\n\nTo avoid infinite games, `CYCLES_TO_DIE` will be decremented by `CYCLE_DELTA` under certain conditions:\n\n- If during the last life loop there were at least `NBR_LIVE` successfully executed by the players.\n- If it has been `MAX_CHECKS` life loops since it was decremented last time.\n\n> Notice that some smart players may trick another player to start making `live` statements for them, this virtually means a player can still make `live` statements after all its processes were killed.\n\n### The Assembly language\n\nIn the assembly file there must be a `.name \"[Name of the player]\"` field and a `.description \"[Description of the player]\"` before any instruction.\n\nEvery instruction has to be on a single line and may be preceded by a label declaration.\nThe instruction name is separated from the optional label and the parameters by one or more spaces.\n\nThe parameters are separated from each other by `,`.\n\nThe instructions will be of different sizes depending on the number and type of parameters passed.\n\n#### Parameters types\n\n- Register parameter\n\nEach process has its own registers (from 1 to `REG_NUMBER`).\nEach of those registers can hold 32 bits, but the register number itself is written in only 8 bits (which are enough to go from 1 to 16).\n\nThey are formatted as `r1`, `r2`, `...`, `r16`.\n\nThe VM will initialize the registers to `0` for each player except for `r1` which will have `- PLAYER_ID`, so for the first player `r1 == -1`.\n\n- Direct parameter\n\nA direct parameter is a value that represents itself, it is formatted by using `%` before the value. So `%10` will represent the number ten.\n\n- Indirect parameter\n\nAn indirect parameter will give you the relative position of the address where to look for the value, think of it as an ancestor of raw pointers.\n\nIn this case `10` will say to the VM to look ten bytes forward the current instruction and take the value from there.\n\n> Don't be scared to use the provided Asm and VM to play with those different parameters in order to be sure you understood properly their behavior.\n\n#### Instruction Set\n\n| Name  | Nb Params | Opcode | Nb Cycles | Has Pcode | Has Idx | Params                                                                     |\n| ----- | --------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| live  | 1         | 1      | 10        | false     | false   | Direct                                                                     |\n| ld    | 2         | 2      | 5         | true      | false   | [Indirect, Direct]<br> Register                                            |\n| st    | 2         | 3      | 5         | true      | false   | Register<br>[Register, Indirect]                                           |\n| add   | 3         | 4      | 10        | true      | false   | Register<br> Register<br> Register                                         |\n| sub   | 3         | 5      | 10        | true      | false   | Register<br> Register<br> Register                                         |\n| and   | 3         | 6      | 6         | true      | false   | [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> Register |\n| or    | 3         | 7      | 6         | true      | false   | [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> Register |\n| xor   | 3         | 8      | 6         | true      | false   | [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> Register |\n| zjmp  | 1         | 9      | 20        | false     | true    | Direct                                                                     |\n| ldi   | 3         | 10     | 25        | true      | true    | [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Direct]<br> Register           |\n| sti   | 3         | 11     | 25        | true      | true    | Register<br> [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Direct]           |\n| fork  | 1         | 12     | 800       | false     | true    | Direct                                                                     |\n| lld   | 2         | 13     | 10        | true      | false   | [Indirect, Direct]<br> Register                                            |\n| lldi  | 3         | 14     | 50        | true      | true    | [Register, Indirect, Direct]<br> [Register, Direct]                        |\n| lfork | 1         | 15     | 1000      | false     | true    | Direct                                                                     |\n| nop   | 1         | 16     | 2         | true      | false   | Register                                                                   |\n\n- `live`: says to the VM the player with the id matching the opposite of the first parameter is alive.

(The VM will apply `% IDX_MOD` to the first argument)\n- `lld`, `lldi`, `lfork`: those instructions are the long versions of `ld`, `ldi` and `fork`, which means the addresses won't be truncated by `IDX_MOD`. (Since those instructions are \"long\" the modulo operation won't be applied on them)\n- `nop`: this operation does nothing, it can still take one argument and has a pcode so be careful on how you implement it.\n\n> All addresses are relative to the current PC of the process.\n\n> Some instructions have to truncate the addresses they are given by applying modulo `IDX_MOD`.\n> This feature prevents players from reaching spaces in memory that are too far from the current PC, which means processes won't be able to attack each other straight away but will need to move by doing smaller steps, this help having more balanced games.\n\n#### Labels\n\nLabels are also called pseudo instructions, in the sense they won't be translated into binary code.\nThey are widely used to help programmers creating assembly code without needing to remember and count relative memory positions.\n\nSo when looking in the binaries the labels will be replaced in order to match their relative position in bytes from the place they were used.\n\nAs an example in the `ameba.s` player `zjmp %:hello` is exactly the same of `zjmp %-5` (`-5` being `ff fb` in hexadecimal notation).\n\nThis is because from the `zjmp` you will need to go back 5 bytes in order to match the label `hello:` declaration.\n\n> Notice that labels can be declared at the start of an instruction or on their own line.\n\n#### Pcode field\n\nSome instruction may accept different kind of parameters, and those parameters may require different sizes.\nFor those instructions the assembler will use a byte after the opcode to inform the VM which kind of parameters to expect.\n\nEvery two bits of this byte will inform the VM about the type of a parameter.\n\n- `01` will be used for a register parameter.\n- `10` will be used for a direct parameter.\n- `11` will be used for an indirect parameter.\n\nAn example of a pcode byte could be `01111000`:\n\nHere the first parameter is expected to be a register, the second should be an indirect value and the third a direct value.\n\n> Those numbers are in binary base, for example `10` in binary is `2` in decimal.\n\n#### Has IDX field\n\nSome instruction will sum up direct values and/or use them as addresses to lookup into the arena memory space. For this reason we know that a full 32 bits integer won't be necessary and to save space we do save direct values on only two bytes in those cases.\n\nYou have `Had Idx` column in the Instruction Set table, when it is true you must save and read direct parameters on two bytes, when false they will be saved on four bytes as usual.\n\n#### The Carry flag\n\nIn all processors you will find a carry which is a flag that notify some edge case states to allow special operations, ensure security and serve many others functionalities.\n\nThe Carry of the processes in the VM is in that sense a simplified version of this concept.\n\nThe following commands will modify the carry of the process executing them: `ld`, `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`.\n\nThose commands will set the carry to `true` if the value written in the register is `0`, and set it to `false` otherwise.\n\nOnly one command reads the carry and it's `zjmp`, it will do the jump if the carry is true and will do nothing otherwise.\n\n#### The file signature\n\nThe signature, also called magic, of a file is a particular value written at the start of a binary. This signature has the role to help the OS understand which kind of file it is and how to execute it. For the `.cor` files the signature is provided in the config file.\n\n### Your player\n\nWhile the main focus for now is to create an Asm and a VM, you should provide a basic player that should be able to fight and win against the `ameba.s`, this player will be tested in the provided VM during evaluation.\n\n### Resources\n\n#### Config file\n\nThe specification requires a lot of constants, it would be tedious to define them in the subject every time they are mentioned.\n\nFor this reason we provide a [config file](data/config.md) which includes all the required constants. Some of them are specific to the Asm, some others to the VM, the vast majority will be helpful to both.\n\n> While the file is language agnostic, it would be very easy to translate it to a specific language. We suggest you to do so in order to centralize the configuration, it will help to debug and extend easily your programs if needed.\n\n#### A basic player\n\nTo help understand better how the Asm and the VM works, let's deep dive into the assembly code with a very basic player:\n\n```\n.name \"ameba\"\n.description \"not doing much\"\n\n        sti r1,%:hello,%1\n        and r1,%0,r1\n\nhello:  live %1\n        zjmp %:hello\n```\n\nThis player is one of the most basic living things you can imagine, it just says it is alive.\n\nHere is how it proceeds in order to do so:\n\n- The `sti` instruction will copy the value in the first register (which is the opposite of its id, so `-1` if this player is the first one).\n- It is interesting that this number will be copied at the address in memory corresponding to the label `hello` + 1 byte.\n- Said in other words this instruction is changing the argument of the `live` statement.\n- The `and` instruction will copy the result of the AND logic operator into the first register.\n- This result will be zero since any number AND 0 is zero. This has the side effect of setting the carry of this process to true.\n- The `live` statement notify the VM the player is alive. Notice the specific value of the argument is irrelevant in this context since the `sti` instruction override it before the `live` is executed.\n- The `zjmp` brings the PC back to the start of the live instruction (creating a loop).\n- Notice `zjmp` only operates the jump if the carry is not equal to zero. This is why we executed the `and` instruction before.\n\nNow let's see what this player binary looks like with `hexdump -C ameba.cor`:\n\n```\n00000000  00 ea 83 f3 61 6d 65 62  61 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |....ameba.......|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n00000080  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 17 6e 6f 74 20  |............not |\n00000090  64 6f 69 6e 67 20 6d 75  63 68 00 00 00 00 00 00  |doing much......|\n000000a0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n00000890  0b 68 01 00 0f 00 01 06  64 01 00 00 00 00 01 01  |.h......d.......|\n000008a0  00 00 00 01 09 ff fb                              |.......|\n000008a7\n```\n\n- All numbers are represented in hexadecimal.\n- At the start of each line there is the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal.\n- This means that for the second line `10` hex is actually 16 in decimal notation.\n- The right panel shows a `.` if the byte is not a valid ASCII character.\n- Repeated lines are aggregated under `*`, this is why we pass from `10` to `80`.\n- Each `xx` is a byte (a byte is 8 bits, `ff` in hexadecimal is `1111 1111` in binary, `255` in decimal).\n\nLet's read it through:\n\n- The first 4 bytes `00 ea 83 f3` are the program signature (also called the magic), this is a 32 bits integer, represented as four 8 bits slices.\n- Then the next 128 bits are for the name of the program, the first five `61 6d 65 62 61` are the actual name, the others are zeros because we don't actually need it.\n- Then we have 4 bytes `00 00 00 17` (so 23) which will be a 32 bits integer with the size in bytes of the program to be executed in the arena of the VM (so only the size of the instructions, without the name, description, signature and so on).\n- Then we have the description which works exactly the same as the name but it will add four bytes padding at the end of it.\n\nThe actual instructions start from there:\n\n- The instruction `sti` is made by those bytes: `0b 68 01 00 0f 00 01`.\n- `0b` is the opcode, `68` is the pcode, `01` is the first parameter, `00 0f` is the second parameter and `00 01` is the third parameter.\n- Notice the last two parameters are written on two bytes each because `sti` has `Has Idx` set to true.\n- Next instruction is `and`, and it is `06 64 01 00 00 00 00 01`.\n- `06` is the opcode, `64` is the pcode, the first parameter is `01`, the second one is `00 00 00 00` and the third one is `01`.\n- Here comes the `live` instruction: `01 00 00 00 01`.\n- `01` is the opcode, `00 00 00 01` is the first parameter, notice the parameter memory space will be overridden by the `sti` instruction.\n- The last instruction is `zjmp`: `09 ff fb`.\n- `01` is the opcode while `ff fb` is the first parameter (on two bytes because of `Has Idx` once again).\n\n#### Testing environment\n\nYou will be provided with a [playground](data/playground.zip) containing:\n\n- A VM and an Assembler binaries to use as references.\n- A Dockerfile to run the binaries in a container.\n- Instructions on how to execute the references.\n- Some players to use as tests.\n\n> The provided VM has an extra flag `-v` which you can use to print the state of the VM at every cycle, this should greatly help you during development and debugging.\n\n### Some advices for the road\n\nWhile the functioning of the VM and the Assembler may seem quite strange and obscure, it is a perfect scenario to reproduce a CPU and understand what a computer really does at its core.\n\nIn this project you are indeed creating a Turing Complete machine largely inspired by Von Neumann architecture (which is still how today's processors works).\n\n### Bonus\n\nThose bonuses will be evaluated only if the Assembler and the VM are perfect.\nYou can use external libraries (for example graphic libraries) in order to achieve them.\n\n- Create a disassembler that will take binary as input and return a `.s` file as output.\n- Create a visualizer to show what is happening in the VM in real time.\n- Introduce arithmetic operations support in the Assembly language.\n- Introduce a simple macro system in the Assembly language.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)\n- [Von Neumann Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture)\n",

If the thread is not dropped, the state will be `false`, and will be `true` otherwise.\n\n- `Thread` containing:\n  - `pid`: the id of the thread.\n  - `cmd`: the name of the thread.\n  - `parent`: a reference to the structure `ThreadPool`.\n\nYou'll also need to add the following associated functions to the structures:\n\n- `ThreadPool` :\n  - `new`: initializes the structure with default values.\n  - `new_thread`: creates a new thread and mutates own state accordingly. Returns a tuple with the `pid` and a new `Thread`.\n  - `is_dropped`: that receives a `pid` and returns whether the thread was already dropped.\n  - `thread_len`: returns the length of the `states` vector. (The index of the next new thread).\n  - `drop_thread`: this **should be called when dropping a `Thread`**. It will receive a `pid` that will be used to change the state of the thread. If the thread was already dropped then it will panic with the message `\"X is already dropped\"`, where `X` represents the `pid`. Otherwise it should change the state to `true` and increment the `drops` field by 1.\n\n- `Thread`:\n  - `new`: initializes a new thread.\n  - `skill`: function that drops the thread.\n\n- You must implement the `Drop` trait for the `Thread` structure. In this trait you must call the function `add_drop` so that the state of the thread changes.\n\n### Expected Functions\n\n```rust\nuse std::cell::{Cell, RefCell};\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct ThreadPool {\n    pub drops: Cell<usize>,\n    pub states: RefCell<Vec<bool>>\n}\n\nimpl ThreadPool {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        todo!()\n    }\n\n    pub fn new_thread(&self, c: String) -> (usize, Thread) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n\n    pub fn thread_len(&self) -> usize {\n        todo!()\n    }\n\n    pub fn is_dropped(&self, id: usize) -> bool {\n        todo!()\n    }\n\n    pub fn drop_thread(&self, id: usize) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Thread {\n    // expected public fields\n}\n\nimpl<'a> Thread<'a> {\n    pub fn new(p: usize, c: String, t: &'a ThreadPool) -> Self {\n        todo!()\n    }\n\n    pub fn skill(self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Drop for Thread<'_> {}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a program to test your function,\n\n```rust\nuse std::rc::Rc;\nuse drop_the_thread::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let pool = ThreadPool::new();\n    let (id, thread) = pool.new_thread(String::from(\"command\"));\n    let (id1, thread1) = pool.new_thread(String::from(\"command1\"));\n\n    thread.skill();\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", (pool.is_dropped(id), id, &pool.drops));\n\n    thread1.skill();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", (pool.is_dropped(id1), id1, &pool.drops));\n\n    let (id2, thread2) = pool.new_thread(String::from(\"command2\"));\n    let thread2 = Rc::new(thread2);\n    let thread2_clone = thread2.clone();\n\n    drop(thread2_clone);\n\n    println!(\"{:?}\", (pool.is_dropped(id2), id2, &pool.drops, Rc::strong_count(&thread2)));\n}\n```\n\nAnd its output:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\n(true, 0, Cell { value: 1 })\n(true, 1, Cell { value: 2 })\n(false, 2, Cell { value: 2 }, 1)\n$\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Trait std::ops::Drop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)\n- [Struct std::cell::RefCell](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html)\n- [Interior Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html)\n",

You can now understand why people say that developers are lazy. You want to do more, but doing less. That's normal.\nTo begin, let's try to enhance your own routine. Every morning you do the same researches to stay aware and be prepared for your new day. We're going to save this precious time.\nTo do so, we're going to create a script which automates this researches by simulating them in a browser, get the informations you want, and display them all gathered in the console.\n\n> We are talking here about your own interests. This can be found only in yourself. What's relevant to you to begin a new day? It is very personnal, be creative!\n> Some examples we could see in other people minds: get the weather, the last podcast/article of a media that you like, the last post of a someone/something you follow, your horoscope, the tv program of the day, etc.\n\nAbout the browser control, you must:\n\n- handle the opening and the closure of the browser\n- navigate to a specific url\n- click on an element which triggers an event in the page (display something, register to something, like something...)\n- navigate in a website\n- get the text content of an element\n- get the url of an element\n\nIn the end:\n\n- The whole browser control must execute itself without being seen.\n- Your `ephemeris` must appear in your console.\n- The script has to finish and close properly.\n\n#### Using puppeteer\n\nIn order to get your daily informations out of your favorite websites, you'll have to use the `puppeteer` API.\n\nFirst, create a new repository named `ephemeris` and run this command line in your terminal, in the repository:\n\n```console\n$ npm install puppeteer\n```\n\nThen, create a new file `ephemeris.mjs` in which you will use the puppeteer module:\n\n```js\nimport puppeteer from 'puppeteer'\n\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({\n  headless: false, // to be commented or removed when project is submitted\n  devtools: true, // to be commented or removed when project is submitted\n})\nconst [page] = await browser.pages()\n// actions...\nawait browser.close() // you can comment this during you tests\nprocess.exit(0) // terminate the process as succeeded (you can comment this during you tests)\n```\n\n**Puppeteer helper - script model**\n\n```javascript\n// navigate to a specific url\nawait page.goto('https://www.google.com/')\n\n// wait an element in the page\nawait page.waitForSelector('input#myId')\n\n// find an element in the page:\nconst button = await page.$('button#myId')\n// check the element was found\nif (button) {\n  // use the element\n  await button.click()\n} else {\n  // do something else: for example treat the exception as an error\n  console.error('Button not found !')\n  // and terminate the process as failed (code 1)\n  process.exit(1)\n}\n\n// navigate in a website\nawait Promise.all([page.waitForNavigation(), page.click('div#myId')])\n\n// get the textContent of an element\nconst myText = await page.$eval('div#myId', (elem) => elem.textContent)\n\n// type something in an input\nawait page.type(`input#myId`, 'some text')\n```\n\n### Optional\n\n1. Pimp your output. Here are some ideas or examples, be **creative**:\n\n   - Put some colors in your text\n   - Associate an emoji to the weather `(< 10°: ❄️; > 10° && < 20°: ☀️; > 20°: 🔥)`\n   - Add randoms messages to say hello\n   - Etc.\n\n2. Generate a `ephemeris.html` file from this ephemeris\n\n   - Check the first raid! you can use the `style.css` and the `cards` section of the `html` file as an inspiration...\n\n3. Save a file every day in a `/history` folder (with its date) and display the 10 latest files of the history in an HTML page.\n\n4. Integrate your `ephemeris` in the result of your first `carbon-copy` raid, on the `cards` section.\n   - Integration must be dynamic: _each day, your new ephemeris should replace the old one._\n\n### Notions\n\n- [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)\n- [HTML Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)\n- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)\n- [Node process: `exit`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_exit_code)\n- [Node file system: `readdir`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_readdir_path_options)\n- [Node file system: `readFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_readfile_path_options)\n- [Node file system: `writeFile`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fspromises_writefile_file_data_options)\n- [Node path: `resolve`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_paths)\n- [`getElementById`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById))\n- [`textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)\n- [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)\n",

      "full_content": "## Filler\n\n### The Game:\n\nWhat is filler?\n\nFiller is an algorithmic game which consists in filling a grid of a known size in advance with pieces of a random size and shape, provided by the `game_engine`. In this game, two robots fight against each other, one after the other on the Anfield.\n\nEach player will receive a game piece to place on the Anfield with exactly one cell of overlapping with its previous territory (meaning the region you've already placed your pieces on the Anfield). The shape of robots territory must not exceed the area of the Anfield. You cannot overlap your opponent pieces, neither him can overlap yours.\n\nIf one player cannot place any piece on the Anfield, he stops there while the other player can keep on placing pieces in order to achieve the maximum score possible, each piece that the player can put correctly on the Anfield will give him more points.\nThe player who occupy the biggest surface on the Anfield wins.\n\n### The Anfield:\n\nThe Anfield is a two-dimensional grid with an arbitrary number of rows and columns where the robots will fight. To launch the game, we will provide you with some initial Anfield that must be passed as an argument to the `game_engine`. If you want you can create your own Anfield, remember it must have the starting position for each of the robots.\n\nHere is an example of an initial Anfield of 30 by 14 :\n\n```\n..............................\n..............................\n..$...........................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n..............................\n...........................@..\n..............................\n..............................\n\n```\n\n### The pieces\n\nThe pieces are managed randomly by the `game_engine`. You can’t predict their size or shape until the `game_engine` transmits them to your program. Here are some examples of possible pieces to give you an idea:\n\n```\nPiece 2 2:\n.#\n#.\n\nPiece 5 4:\n.##..\n.##..\n..#..\n...#.\n\nPiece 6 3:\n.##...\n###...\n#..#..\n```\n\n### The Robots\n\nThe principle is simple, two robots compete on the Anfield, and they must place, in turns, the piece that the `game_engine` randomly gives them, earning points each time they place a piece correctly. The game ends when none of the two players can place a piece or if one of the two players return an unexpected error (timeout, segfault, memory issues and so on). If only one player can't place a piece or place it in an incorrect way his move is ignored but the game continue for the other player.\n\nYour goal is to win against all our robots, except the `terminator`. You'll have to know the following:\n\n- The `game_engine` will run your program and write the Anfield and the piece to place in the standard input.\n\n- Each turn, the `game_engine` rewrites the Anfield and includes a new random piece to be placed.\n\n- The first line the `game_engine` will send to the robot is it's player number in the following format `$$$ exec p<number> : [<player path>]`\n\n- In order to place the game piece on the Anfield, the player will have to write it’s coordinates on the standard output.\n\n- The following format must be used `X Y\\n`.\n\n- To be able to place a piece on the Anfield, it is mandatory that one, and only one cell of the shape (in your piece) covers the cell of a shape placed previously (your territory).\n\n- You will collect points each time you place a piece.\n\n- If you are the `Player 1` your program will be represented by `a` and `@`. If you are `Player 2`, your program will be represented by `s` and `$`.\n\n- The lowercases (`s` or `a`) will highlight the piece last placed on the Anfield. At the following turns, that same piece will be represented by the symbols (`$` or `@`), as it won’t be the piece last placed anymore.\n\n- If the solution is wrong the `game_engine` won't make the robot play anymore but the game continues for the other player.\n\n- If there is a timeout or any other kind of unexpected error from the player the game stops and the player loses.\n\n- If your robot can't place anymore peaces he should still return a result (even if invalid), our robots for example return `0 0\\n`, when they can't place any more pieces.\n\n### The Game_engine\n\nThe `game_engine` will be provided to you and it will run in a docker container.\n\nHere are the flags that can be used:\n\n```\n  -f, -file string\n       Path to map\n  -p1, -player1 string\n       Path to AI one\n  -p2, -player2 string\n       Path to AI two\n  -q, -quiet\n       Quiet mode\n  -r, -refresh\n       Throttling mode\n  -s, -seed int\n       Use a random seed number\n  -t, -time int\n       Set timeout in seconds (default 10)\n```\n\n#### Docker\n\nFor the filler project you must use Docker. You can read about docker basics in the [ascii-art-web-dockerize](../ascii-art-web/dockerize/README.md) subject.\n\nFollow this instructions to get the game running:\n\nThe `docker_image` folder will be provided to you as a zip file, you can download it [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/filler/filler.zip).\n\nInside the folder you will find the `Dockerfile`, the `game_engine`, the `maps` and the `robots`.\n\nIn order to set everything up you will need to follow these steps:\n\n- Go inside the folder and build the image `docker build -t filler .`\n- Run the container `docker run -v \"$(pwd)/solution\":/filler/solution -it filler`. This instruction will open a terminal in the container, the directory `solution` will be mounted in the container as well.\n- Your solution should be inside the `solution` directory so it will be mounted inside the container.\n- You can code your solution from the host machine with your favorite editor but don't forget to compile it and run it from the container terminal.\n\nExample of how you can run the game inside the container:\n\n`./game_engine -f maps/map01 -p1 robots/bender -p2 robots/terminator`\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is an example of the first input that the `game_engine` will send to player 1:\n\n```\n$$$ exec p1 : [robots/bender]\nAnfield 20 15:\n    01234567890123456789\n000 ....................\n001 ....................\n002 .........@..........\n003 ....................\n004 ....................\n005 ....................\n006 ....................\n007 ....................\n008 ....................\n009 ....................\n010 ....................\n011 ....................\n012 .........$..........\n013 ....................\n014 ....................\nPiece 4 1:\n.OO.\n```\n\nAnd his response:\n\n```\n7 2\\n\n```\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Create a graphic visualizer for this project.\n- Create a player that can beat our `terminator` robot.\n",

The program should output a list of pairs, each representing the indices of the elements that form the pair.\n\nIn this exercise you must take in consideration the following:\n\n- Ensure it's possible to have positive or negative integers in the array.\n- Ensure each element is used only once in a pair, although the element can be repeated in different pairs.\n- Allow for multiple pairs to sum up to the target value.\n- The output messages should follow the one given in the examples bellow.\n- Return the message **\"No pairs found.\"** when no pair is present.\n- Return the message **\"Invalid target sum.\"** if the target is invalid.\n- Return the message **\"Invalid number: <number>\"** if the number in the array is invalid.\n- For any input format that deviates from the specified format `\"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\" \"6\"`, the program will return an \"Invalid input.\" error message.\n\nLet's consider the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the target sum `targetSum = 6`. When we run the program, the `findPairs()` function will search for pairs in the array that sum up to `targetSum`.\n\nHere is some example of outputs:\n\n```console\n$ go run . \"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\" \"6\"\nPairs with sum 6: [[0 4] [1 3]]\n$ go run . \"[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]\" \"1\"\nPairs with sum 1: [[0 1] [2 3]]\n$ go run . \"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\" \"10\"\nNo pairs found.\n$ go run . \"[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]\" \"-5\"\nPairs with sum -5: [[0 3] [1 2]]\n$ go run . \"[1, 2, 3, 4, 20, -4, 5]\" \"2 5\"\nInvalid target sum.\n$ go run . \"[1, 2, 3, 4, 20, p, 5]\" \"5\"\nInvalid number: p\n$ go run . \"[1, 2, 3, 4\" \"5\"\nInvalid input.\n$ go run . \"1, 2, 3, 4\" \"5\"\nInvalid input.\n$\n```\n",

It enables you to create a database as well as controlling it by using queries.\n\nTo structure your database and to achieve better performance we highly advise you to take a look at the [entity relationship diagram](https://www.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/) and build one based on your own database.\n\n- You must use at least one SELECT, one CREATE and one INSERT queries.\n\nTo know more about SQLite you can check the [SQLite page](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).\n\n#### Authentication\n\nIn this segment the client must be able to `register` as a new user on the forum, by inputting their credentials. You also have to create a `login session` to access the forum and be able to add posts and comments.\n\nYou should use cookies to allow each user to have only one opened session. Each of this sessions must contain an expiration date. It is up to you to decide how long the cookie stays \"alive\". The use of UUID is a Bonus task.\n\nInstructions for user registration:\n\n- Must ask for email\n  - When the email is already taken return an error response.\n- Must ask for username\n- Must ask for password\n  - The password must be encrypted when stored (this is a Bonus task)\n\nThe forum must be able to check if the email provided is present in the database and if all credentials are correct. It will check if the password is the same with the one provided and, if the password is not the same, it will return an error response.\n\n#### Communication\n\nIn order for users to communicate between each other, they will have to be able to create posts and comments.\n\n- Only registered users will be able to create posts and comments.\n- When registered users are creating a post they can associate one or more categories to it.\n  - The implementation and choice of the categories is up to you.\n- The posts and comments should be visible to all users (registered or not).\n- Non-registered users will only be able to see posts and comments.\n\n#### Likes and Dislikes\n\nOnly registered users will be able to like or dislike posts and comments.\n\nThe number of likes and dislikes should be visible by all users (registered or not).\n\n#### Filter\n\nYou need to implement a filter mechanism, that will allow users to filter the displayed posts by :\n\n- categories\n- created posts\n- liked posts\n\nYou can look at filtering by categories as subforums. A subforum is a section of an online forum dedicated to a specific topic.\n\nNote that the last two are only available for registered users and must refer to the logged in user.\n\n#### Docker\n\nFor the forum project you must use Docker. You can read about docker basics in the [ascii-art-web-dockerize](../ascii-art-web/dockerize/README.md) subject.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- You must use **SQLite**.\n- You must handle website errors, HTTP status.\n- You must handle all sort of technical errors.\n- The code must respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md).\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).\n\n### Allowed packages\n\n- All [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed.\n- [sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)\n- [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)\n- [gofrs/uuid](https://github.com/gofrs/uuid) or [google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid)\n\n> You must not use any frontend libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, Vue etc.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- The basics of web :\n  - HTML\n  - HTTP\n  - [Sessions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-management-waf-protections) and [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n- Using and [setting up Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n  - Containerizing an application\n  - Compatibility/Dependency\n  - Creating images\n- SQL language\n  - Manipulation of databases\n- The basics of encryption\n",

      "full_content": "## Git Ready\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis project is designed to introduce you to the world of version control and collaboration using **Git**. Git is a powerful and widely used tool for tracking changes in your projects, collaborating with others, and ensuring the integrity of your code.\n\nThroughout this project, you will embark on a journey of progressively building your Git skills. Starting from the basics, you'll gradually explore more advanced topics, equipping yourself with the essential knowledge and practices for effective version control and collaboration.\n\nLet's Git ready for it!\n\n### Instructions\n\nTo begin, create a `work` directory and organize all your tasks within it. Each exercise should be encapsulated in its own file, named after the corresponding task for clarity and ease of reference.\n\nAccompanying your work, provide documentation or a report detailing the process followed for each exercise. This documentation should include any challenges faced, solutions implemented, and lessons learned. It could be in the form of a README file or a separate document. Make sure to show it to the auditor during evaluation.\n\n> ⚠️ Your completion of tasks will be evaluated based on the commit history reflecting the changes made throughout the exercises and the presence of accompanying documentation detailing the process followed.\n\nHere is an example of a file that you can deliver to your auditor to help with the review process:\n\n```md\n#### Conflicts, merging and rebasing\n\n# Merge Main into Greet Branch\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# Switch to main branch and make changes to hello.sh file\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# Merging Main into Greet Branch (Conflict)\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# Resolve the conflict (manually or using merge tools)\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# After resolving, stage the changes and commit\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# Rebasing Greet Branch\n\n<Write the command here>\n\n# Merging Greet into Main\n\n<Write the command here>\n```\n\n#### Setting Up Git\n\n- Install Git on your local machine by following the instructions for your operating system on the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n- Configure Git with your username and email address.\n\n#### Git commits to commit\n\n- Within the `work` directory, establish a subdirectory named `hello`. Inside this directory, generate a file titled `hello.sh` and input the following content:\n\n```sh\necho \"Hello, World\"\n```\n\n- Initialize the git repository in the `hello` directory.\n- Check the status and act accordingly with the output of the executed command.\n- Change the `hello.sh` content to the following:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Hello, $1\"\n```\n\n- Stage the changed file and commit the changes, the working tree should be clean.\n- Modify the `hello.sh` file to include comments and stage it.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Default is \"World\"\nname=${1:-\"World\"}\necho \"Hello, $name\"\n```\n\n- Make two separate commits:\n  - The first commit should be for the comment in line 3.\n  - The second commit should include changes made to lines 4 and 5.\n\n#### History\n\n- Show the history of the working directory.\n- Show One-Line History for a condensed view showing only commit hashes and messages.\n- **Controlled Entries**:\n  - You need to customize the log output by specifying the number of entries or a time range. Customize it to display the last `2 entries` and to view the `commits made within the last 5 minutes`.\n- **Personalized Format**:\n  - Show logs in a personalized format, including the commit hash, date, message, branch information, and author name, resembling `* e4e3645 2023-06-10 | Added a comment (HEAD -> main) [John Doe]`\n\n#### Check it out\n\n- **Restore First Snapshot**:\n  - Revert the working tree to its initial state, as captured in the first snapshot, and then print the content of the `hello.sh` file.\n- **Restore Second Recent Snapshot**:\n  - Revert the working tree to the second most recent snapshot and print the content of the `hello.sh` file.\n- **Return to Latest Version**:\n  - Ensure that the working directory reflects the latest version of the `hello.sh` file present in the main branch, without referring to specific commit hashes.\n\n#### TAG me\n\n- **Referencing Current Version**:\n  - Tag the current version of the repository as `v1`.\n- **Tagging Previous Version**:\n  - Tag the version immediately prior to the current version as `v1-beta`, without relying on commit hashes to navigate through the history.\n- **Navigating Tagged Versions**:\n  - Move back and forth between the two tagged versions, `v1` and `v1-beta`.\n- **Listing Tags**:\n  - Display a list of all tags present in the repository to verify successful tagging.\n\n#### Changed your mind?\n\n- **Reverting Changes**:\n  - Modify the latest version of the file with unwanted comments, then revert it back to its original state before staging using a `Git` command.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This is a bad comment. We want to revert it.\nname=${1:-\"World\"}\n\necho \"Hello, $name\"\n```\n\n- **Staging and Cleaning**:\n  - Introduce unwanted changes to the file, stage them, then clean the staging area to discard the changes.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This is an unwanted but staged comment\nname=${1:-\"World\"}\n\necho \"Hello, $name\"\n```\n\n- **Committing and Reverting**:\n  - Add the following unwanted changes again, stage the file, commit the changes, then revert them back to their original state.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This is an unwanted but committed change\nname=${1:-\"World\"}\n\necho \"Hello, $name\"\n```\n\n- **Tagging and Removing Commits**:\n  - Tag the latest commit with `oops`, then remove commits made after the `v1` version. Ensure that the `HEAD` points to `v1`.\n- **Displaying Logs with Deleted Commits**:\n  - Show the logs with the deleted commits displayed, particularly focusing on the commit tagged `oops`.\n- **Cleaning Unreferenced Commits**:\n  - Ensure that unreferenced commits are deleted from the history, meaning there should be no logs for these deleted commits.\n- **Author Information**:\n  - Add an author comment to the file and commit the changes.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Default is World\n# Author: Jim Weirich\nname=${1:-\"World\"}\n\necho \"Hello, $name\"\n```\n\n- Oops the author email was forgotten, update the file to include the email without making a new commit, but include the change in the last commit.\n\n#### Move it\n\n- **Moving hello.sh**:\n  - Using Git commands, move the program `hello.sh` into a `lib/` directory, and then commit the move.\n  - Create a `Makefile` in the root directory of the repository with the provided content and commit it to the repository.\n\n```sh\nTARGET=\"lib/hello.sh\"\n\nrun:\n\tbash ${TARGET}\n```\n\n#### blobs, trees and commits\n\n- **Exploring `.git/` Directory**:\n  - Navigate to the `.git/` directory in your project and examine its contents.You will have to explain the purpose of each subdirectory, including `objects/`, `config`, `refs`, and `HEAD` in the audit.\n- **Latest Object Hash**:\n  - Find the latest object hash within the `.git/objects/` directory using Git commands and print the type and content of this object using Git commands.\n- **Dumping Directory Tree**:\n  - Use Git commands to dump the directory tree referenced by this commit.\n  - Dump the contents of the `lib/` directory and the `hello.sh` file using Git commands.\n\n#### Branching\n\nIt’s time to do a major rewrite of the hello world functionality. Since this might take a while, you’ll want to put these changes into a separate branch to isolate them from changes in the main branch.\n\n- **Create and Switch to New Branch**:\n  - Create a local branch named `greet` and switch to it.\n  - In the `lib` directory, create a new file named `greeter.sh` and add the provided code to it. Commit these changes.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nGreeter() {\n    who=\"$1\"\n    echo \"Hello, $who\"\n}\n\n```\n\n- Update the `lib/hello.sh` file by adding the content below, stage and commit the changes.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsource lib/greeter.sh\n\nname=\"$1\"\nif [ -z \"$name\" ]; then\n    name=\"World\"\nfi\n\nGreeter \"$name\"\n```\n\n- Update the `Makefile` with the following comment and commit the changes.\n\n```sh\n# Ensure it runs the updated lib/hello.sh file\nTARGET=\"lib/hello.sh\"\n\nrun:\n\tbash ${TARGET}\n```\n\n- Switch back to the `main` branch, compare and show the differences between the `main` and `greet` branches for `Makefile`, `hello.sh`, and `greeter.sh` files.\n- Generate a `README.md` file for the project with the provided content. Commit this file.\n\n```console\nThis is the Hello World example from the git project.\n```\n\n- Draw a commit tree diagram illustrating the diverging changes between all branches to demonstrate the branch history.\n\n#### Conflicts, merging and rebasing\n\n- **Merge Main into Greet Branch**:\n  - Start by merging the changes from the `main` branch into the `greet` branch.\n  - Switch to `main` branch and make the changes below to the `hello.sh` file, save and commit the changes.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"What's your name\"\nread my_name\n\necho \"Hello, $my_name\"\n```\n\n- **Merging Main into Greet Branch (Conflict)**:\n  - Attempt to merge the `main` branch into `greet`. Bingooo! There you have it, a `conflict`.\n  - Resolve the conflict (manually or using graphical merge tools), accept changes from `main` branch, then commit the conflict resolution.\n- **Rebasing Greet Branch**:\n  - Go back to the point before the initial merge between `main` and `greet`.\n  - Rebase the `greet` branch on top of the latest changes in the `main` branch.\n- **Merging Greet into Main**:\n  - Merge the changes from the `greet` branch into the `main` branch.\n- **Understanding Fast-Forwarding and Differences**:\n  - Explain fast-forwarding and the difference between merging and rebasing.\n\n#### Local and remote repositories\n\n- In the `work/` directory, make a clone of the repository `hello` as `cloned_hello`. (Do not use `copy` command)\n\n- Show the logs for the cloned repository.\n\n- Display the name of the remote repository and provide more information about it.\n\n- List all remote and local branches in the `cloned_hello` repository.\n\n- Make changes to the original repository, update the `README.md` file with the provided content, and commit the changes.\n\n```\nThis is the Hello World example from the git project.\n(changed in the original)\n```\n\n- Inside the cloned repository (`cloned_hello`), fetch the changes from the remote repository and display the logs. Ensure that commits from the `hello` repository are included in the logs.\n\n- Merge the changes from the remote `main` branch into the local `main` branch.\n\n- Add a local branch named `greet` tracking the remote `origin/greet` branch.\n\n- Add a `remote` to your Git repository and push the `main` and `greet` branches to the `remote`.\n\n- Be ready for this question in the audit!\n\n**\"What is the single git command equivalent to what you did before to bring changes from remote to local `main` branch?\"**\n\n#### Bare repositories\n\n- What is a bare repository and why is it needed?\n- Create a bare repository named `hello.git` from the existing `hello` repository.\n- Add the bare `hello.git` repository as a remote to the original repository `hello`.\n- Change the `README.md` file in the original repository with the provided content:\n\n```\nThis is the Hello World example from the git project.\n(Changed in the original and pushed to shared)\n```\n\n- Commit the changes and push them to the shared repository.\n\n- Switch to the cloned repository `cloned_hello` and pull down the changes just pushed to the shared repository.\n\n### Submission and Evaluation\n\nYour work must be submitted at the `gitea` link provided. The evaluation will be carried out based on your submission and according to the following criteria:\n\n- Correctness of the git commands you are using.\n- Clear understanding of the git commands and concepts.\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)\n- [Git Gud](https://github.com/benthayer/git-gud)\n",

Now it is time to get into projects.\n\n### Objectives\n\nIn this project you will use some of your old functions made in your old repository. You will use them with the objective of making a simple text completion/editing/auto-correction tool.\n\nOne more detail. This time the project will be corrected by auditors. The auditors will be other students and you will be an auditor as well.\n\nWe advise you to create your own tests for yourself and for when you will correct your auditees.\n\n### Introduction\n\n- Your project must be written in **Go**.\n- The code should respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md).\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).\n\nThe tool you are about to build will receive as arguments the name of a file containing a text that needs some modifications (the input) and the name of the file the modified text should be placed in (the output). Next is a list of possible modifications that your program should execute:\n\n- Every instance of `(hex)` should replace the word before with the decimal version of the word (in this case the word will always be a hexadecimal number). (Ex: \"1E (hex) files were added\" -> \"30 files were added\")\n- Every instance of `(bin)` should replace the word before with the decimal version of the word (in this case the word will always be a binary number). (Ex: \"It has been 10 (bin) years\" -> \"It has been 2 years\")\n- Every instance of `(up)` converts the word before with the Uppercase version of it. (Ex: \"Ready, set, go (up) !\" -> \"Ready, set, GO!\")\n- Every instance of `(low)` converts the word before with the Lowercase version of it. (Ex: \"I should stop SHOUTING (low)\" -> \"I should stop shouting\")\n- Every instance of `(cap)` converts the word before with the capitalized version of it. (Ex: \"Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge (cap)\" -> \"Welcome to the Brooklyn Bridge\")\n\n  - For `(low)`, `(up)`, `(cap)` if a number appears next to it, like so: `(low, <number>)` it turns the previously specified number of words in lowercase, uppercase or capitalized accordingly. (Ex: \"This is so exciting (up, 2)\" -> \"This is SO EXCITING\")\n\n- Every instance of the punctuations `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:` and `;` should be close to the previous word and with space apart from the next one. (Ex: \"I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!\" -> \"I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!\").\n  - Except if there are groups of punctuation like: `...` or `!?`. In this case the program should format the text as in the following example: \"I was thinking ... You were right\" -> \"I was thinking... You were right\".\n- The punctuation mark `'` will always be found with another instance of it and they should be placed to the right and left of the word in the middle of them, without any spaces. (Ex: \"I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '\" -> \"I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'\")\n  - If there are more than one word between the two `' '` marks, the program should place the marks next to the corresponding words (Ex: \"As Elton John said: ' I am the most well-known homosexual in the world '\" -> \"As Elton John said: 'I am the most well-known homosexual in the world'\")\n- Every instance of `a` should be turned into `an` if the next word begins with a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or a `h`. (Ex: \"There it was. A amazing rock!\" -> \"There it was. An amazing rock!\").\n\n### Allowed packages\n\n- [Standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed.\n\n### Usage\n\n```console\n$ cat sample.txt\nit (cap) was the best of times, it was the worst of times (up) , it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness (cap, 6) , it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, IT WAS THE (low, 3) winter of despair.\n$ go run . sample.txt result.txt\n$ cat result.txt\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of TIMES, it was the age of wisdom, It Was The Age Of Foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\n$ cat sample.txt\nSimply add 42 (hex) and 10 (bin) and you will see the result is 68.\n$ go run . sample.txt result.txt\n$ cat result.txt\nSimply add 66 and 2 and you will see the result is 68.\n$ cat sample.txt\nThere is no greater agony than bearing a untold story inside you.\n$ go run . sample.txt result.txt\n$ cat result.txt\nThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\n$ cat sample.txt\nPunctuation tests are ... kinda boring ,what do you think ?\n$ go run . sample.txt result.txt\n$ cat result.txt\nPunctuation tests are... kinda boring, what do you think?\n```\n\nThis project will help you learn about :\n\n- The Go file system(**fs**) API\n- String and numbers manipulation\n",

Repainting an element every time it animates\n- **Compositing** that consists on placing the pages together at the end\n\nIn order to improve performance we must remove the causes above, that are more costly: layout and painting.\n\nThe best way to remove layout and painting is to use [`transform`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) and [`opacity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity)\n\nRemoving layout can be done using transform:\n\n```js\n// bad\n// this will trigger the layout to recalculate everything and repaint it again\nbox.style.left = `${x * 100}px`\n\n// good\n// this way its possible to lose the layout\nbox.style.transform = `translateX(${x * 100}px)`\n```\n\nIt is possible to remove painting by adding a layer:\n\n```css\n/* this will take care of the painting by creating a layer and transform it*/\n  #box {\n    width: 100px;\n    height: 100px;\n    ....\n    will-change: transform;\n  }\n```\n\nBy creating a new layer you can remove painting, but \"there is always a tradeoff\". If we add to much layers it will increase the **composition** and **update tree**. In conclusion you must promote a new layer only if you know you are going to use it. Performance is the key to a good animation. \"Performance is the art of avoiding work\".\n\n### UI/UX\n\n- [Best Practices](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/guide-design-consistency-best-practices-ui-ux-designers/)\n",

You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.\n\nSo that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.\n\nYour profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:\n\n- Basic user identification\n- XP amount\n- grades\n- audits\n- skills\n\nBeside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou will have to create a profile UI where you can see your own school information. This information/data is present on the GraphQL endpoint, where you will have to query it.\n\nThe UI design is up to you. However, it must have a statistic section where you can generate graphs to see more about your journey and achievements on the school. This graph must be done using [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG). You need to do at least **two different statistic graphs** for the data given. Bear in mind the principles of a [good UI](../good-practices/README.md).\n\nUsing SVG you can create several [types of graphs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/svg/graph.htm) including interactive graphs and animated graph. It will be up to you to decide what type of graphs you are going to do.\n\nHere are some possible combinations for the creation of the graphs:\n\n- XP earned in a time period (progress over time)\n- XP earned by project\n- Audit ratio\n- Projects `PASS` and `FAIL` ratio\n- Piscine (JS/Go) stats\n  - `PASS` and `FAIL` ratio\n  - Attempts for each exercise\n\nAny other information you desire to display is welcome and will be noted.\n\n### Login Page\n\nYou'll need a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) to access the GraphQL API. A JWT can be obtained from the `signin` endpoint (`https://((DOMAIN))/api/auth/signin`).\n\nYou may make a `POST` request to the `signin` endpoint, and supply your credentials using `Basic` authentication, with base64 encoding.\n\nYour login page must function with both:\n\n- username:password\n- email:password\n\nIf the credentials are invalid, an appropriate error message must be displayed.\n\nYou must provide a method to log out.\n\nWhen making GraphQL queries, you'll supply the JWT using `Bearer` authentication.

There are several places where you can host your profile, for example: [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and so on.

If you wanted the `login`,\nyou could just add the attribute to the query like so:\n\n```js\n{\n  user {\n    id\n    login\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is another example of a query using the table `user`:\n\n```js\n{\n  object(where: { id: { _eq: 3323 }}) {\n    name\n    type\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Note: that for this query the introduction of variables (arguments) is **required**, so it will return just one object with the `id` equal to `3323`.\n\nIn GraphQL, the usage of arguments are specified in the schema. You can see the available query parameters by introspecting the API.\n\n> If you're logged in to the platform, you may access [GraphiQL](<https://((DOMAIN))/graphiql/>) to more easily explore the schema.\n\nExample of nesting using the `result` and `user` table:\n\n```js\n{\n  result {\n    id\n    user {\n      id\n      login\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor this example we ask for the results `id` and `user` that is associated to the `result`, requesting the user `login` and his `id`.\n\n**You must use all the types of querying present above** (_normal_, _nested_ and using _arguments_), do not forget that you can use the types together or separately.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)\n- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)\n- [Hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service)\n- [JWT](https://jwt.io)\n- Authentication\n- Authorization\n- Basics of human-computer interface\n  - UI/UX\n",

Either `true`, if\nthe condition is met, or `false` if it's not.\n\nSince they return value, you can assign them to variables, just like functions\nreturn values:\n\n```js\nlet age = 5\nlet ageEqual5 = age === 5 // age is equal to 5\nlet ageNotEqual5 = age !== 5 // age is not equal to 5\nconsole.log(ageEqual5) // true\nconsole.log(ageNotEqual5) // false\n```\n\nBut they are commonly used directly inside an `if` condition.\n\n### Scope `{}`\n\nAfter the condition, a curly brace `{` signal the begining of a scope. The scope\nends at the enclosing `}` a few lines after.\n\nScopes are a way to group lines of code, this allow us to do multiple lines of\ncode if a condition is true.\n\n```js\nif (age > 48) {\n  // <-beginning of the scope of the if condition\n  console.log('You are over 48 years old')\n} // <- end of the scope of the if condition\n```\n\n### Indentation `..` _(2 spaces)_\n\nUpon writing code inside a scope, it's an important convention to **indent** it.\n\nIndenting is when spaces are added at the beginning of the line, here is an\nexample of bad code:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```js\nif (age > 48) {\n// <- without indentation ! bad bad ! unreadable !!\nconsole.log('You are over 48 years old')\n}\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\ngood code:\n\n```js\nif (age > 48) {\n  // <- with indentation, omg so clean, amazing !\n  console.log('You are over 48 years old')\n}\n```\n\nIndenting add a visual indication that the code is inside a scope, while it's\nnot strictly necessary for code to work, it will become very important to keep\nthe code clear.\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou are Griswold the Blacksmith, and you must give the list of items the player\ncan buy with the money he has, here is what you are selling:\n\n- arrows for 3 coins\n- boots for 44 coins\n- sword for 299.99 coins _(limited offer)_\n\nDeclare a `purchasableGoods` array and _conditionally_ push to it all the goods\nthat the player can buy.\n\nUse `if` conditions and compare the cost of the goods with the provided variable\n`playerCoins` that contains the number of coins available to the player.\n\n> You must order elements by price\n",

It is up to you to decide how you will display it.\n\n- This project also focuses on the creation and visualization of events/actions.\n\n  - The event/action you need to implement is a client call to the server (client-server). We can say that it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action necessitates communication with the server in order to receive information ([request-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)).\n  - An event consists of a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- The backend must be written in **Go**.\n- The website and server cannot crash at any time.\n- All the pages must work correctly, and you must take care of any errors.\n- The code must respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md).\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).\n\n### Allowed packages\n\n- Only the [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed.\n\n### Usage\n\n- You can see an example of a RESTful API [here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- Manipulation and storage of data.\n- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files and format.\n- HTML.\n- Event creation and visualization.\n- [Client-server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview).\n",

As this is just an example, if you so wish, a specific range in your program can be given. That is fully up to you to decide. The intent of this exercise is to use the calculations you did in the `math-skills` exercise to guess the numbers.\n\n### Testing\n\nYour program will be extensively tested, so performance should be prioritized. Testing will work as follow:\n\nIf you guess correctly the range for the next given number, your score will be incremented based on the size of your range. In other words, the bigger your range is, the smaller your score will be. So we advise you to find the perfect balance between a small range and a good guess.\n\nIn order for auditors to test your program, you will have to follow the next steps:\n\n- create a folder called **`student`**\n- copy the files that are needed to run your program into this folder\n- write an **executable** shell script named `script.sh` containing the command(s) to run your program, **from the root folder of the provided tester** (see below where to find it)\n\nHere is a following example of the script, assuming that the program is called `solution` and was written in JS(Javascript):\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\n# We assume that we are on the root folder, so we have to enter the\n# student folder in order to run the `solution.js` file\nnode ./student/solution.js\n```\n\nYou can choose one of the following languages to build your program: golang, JS, rust, python.\n\nIf you fail one of these steps, the test will not work. So we advise you to run the test by downloading [this zip file](https://assets.01-edu.org/guess-it/guess-it-dockerized.zip) containing the tester. You should place the `student/` folder in the root directory of the items provided and read its instructions. The data sets used to test this exercise will be `Data 1`, `Data 2` and `Data 3`.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- Statistical and Probabilities Calculation\n- Scripting\n",

      "full_content": "## Hello There 👋\n\n### Installation\n\nFor each programs, make sure you are downloading a version that works for your system\n\n#### Install Visual Studio Code\n\n- Download the [installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)\n\n> If you already have and love a code editor, feel free to use it,\n> but keep in mind that we will use VSCode as reference\n\nVSCode is a code editor, it will give you an interface to write, test and submit your code.\n\n#### Install Git\n\n- Download the [installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- While installing, Git will ask a bunch of questions, it is recommended to change those:\n\t- Choosing the default editor (pick VSCode)\n\t- Configuring the line ending conversions (Choose : Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings)\n\t- Otherwise stick with the defaults unless you know what you are doing.\n\nGit is a versioning tool, we use it to upload your solutions on the school server.\n\n#### Install Node.js\n\n- Download the [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)\n\nNode.js will allow to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser, useful for testing your code.\n\nYou can execute your JavaScript files with `node` like so:\n\n```console\n$ node hello-world.js\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n### Values\n\nThere are 3 types of values, and they can model the **WORLD** !\\\n_(In the end it's all `1`'s and `0`'s for the computer)_, but us, **humans**, need\nan easier way of representing stuff.\n\n> We can all agree that `11010001100101110110011011001101111` is not a very\n> friendly way to say `'hello'` !\n\n#### Numbers 🔢\n\n- Whole numbers: `1`, `23`, `232139283`\n- Negative numbers are prefixed with `-`: `-1`, `-1231`\n- Decimal numbers: `3.14`, `-2.53343` etc...\n\nUse them for _quantities_ like in daily life.\n\n#### Booleans ✖️ / ✔️\n\n- Something is `true`\n- or `false`\n\nThey represent a truth, an answer to a closed-ended question _(anything that can\nbe answered with yes or no)_:\n\n- Is paris the capital of France ? `true`\n- Are you born before 1723 ? `false`\n- Is your screen turned on ? `true` _(most likely)_\n\n#### Strings 🆒\n\n- `'Hello'`\n- `'This is some text'`\n\nA string is a sequence of characters used to represent text, it needs\n**delimiters** to define its _begining_ and _end_.\\\nDelimiters are matching quotes, either `` ` ``, `\"` or `'`.\n\n### Using `console.log`\n\nTo display output from a script into a console, use the function `console.log`:\n\n```js\nconsole.log() // <- will show an empty line\n```\n\nAdd any value between the parentheses to see it appear when the script is\nexecuted.\n\n> It is very important to use this often to validate that our code is valid. The\n> more it is tested, the easier it is to understand what's going on in the code\n> !\n>\n> In doubt, `console.log` everything, don't be shy, they are for free.\n\n### Instructions\n\nOnce you have installed and configured the necessary tools,\ncreate in your [Gitea](<https://((DOMAIN))/git>) account the repository named `((ROOT))` with a `hello-there.js`\nJS file that is a program that displays:\n- the exact text `Hello There !`\n- any `Number` \n- and a `Boolean`.\n\nIn order to work in your repository and put files in it, you need to clone it first. \n\nIf your username was `choumi` this is the command that will need to be used:\n\n```\ngit clone https://((DOMAIN))/git/choumi/((ROOT)).git\n```\nTo execute it, open a Unix shell (e.g. Git Bash on Windows), you are going to type commands in it.\nThis command needs to be adapted with **your own username**.\n\n> Don't forget to commit and push the file to the servers\n\n### Optional (git setting to avoid typing the password every time)\n\nThe `((ROOT))` repository will be the folder where all the exercises must be uploaded.\n\nIn order to avoid writing your username and password every time you `git push` an exercise, \ntell Git to remember your password (like a web browser would) with the below command:\n\n```\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n```\n\n### Recommendation\n\nVideos designed to give **hints** are assigned to each quest. It is strongly suggested to watch them as you go.\n\n### You will learn about\n\n- Code Editor\n- Git\n- JS\n",

Other times you don't want your code to be blocking while waiting.\n\nCreate an asynchronous function `processInfo` in a file `kept-promise.js`. The function `processInfo` will take an asynchronous function as an input, and it will print the message `Ok!` if the return of the input function is zero or a multiple of two, `Error!` otherwise.\n\nThe following function can be used as an example of input function for `processInfo`:\n\n```js\nconst getImportantInfo = async () =>\n  new Promise(resolve => resolve(Math.round(Math.random() * 10)))\n```\n\n> Assume that your function will always get a valid input function\n\n### Example\n\nThe following script `main.js` can be used to test your function:\n\n```js\nimport processInfo from './kept-promise.js'\n\nconst getImportantInfo = () =>\n  new Promise(resolve => resolve(Math.round(Math.random() * 10)))\n\nconsole.log(await processInfo(getImportantInfo))\n```\n\nThe output should be the following:\n\n```console\n$  node main.js\nOk!\n$  node main.js\nError!\n$  node main.js\nOk!\n$\n```\n\n### Hints\n\n- Asynchronous behavior, in the context of server-side JavaScript, refers to the ability of running code in a non-blocking way, meaning for instance that the server can handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for a long-running task to complete, avoiding blocking the server responsiveness. It is essential to achieve scalable and functional back-end Node applications.\n\n- A `Promise` is a special JS object that represent the result (success or failure) of an asynchronous operation. This special object is usually used to \"wrap\" asynchronous operations.\n  `Promise`s can have three different states: _pending_ - the asynchronous operation has not finished yet, _fulfilled_/_resolved_ - the asynchronous operation has finished successfully - or _rejected_ - the asynchronous operation has finished, but something went wrong. When defined from scratch, it is possible to define a `resolve` and `reject` callback function for a new `Promise` that will define the results of the success or failure of asynchronous operation happening inside the `Promise`.\n\n- It is possible to wait for an asynchronous function with the keyword `await`. Alternatively, it can be clearer to use the method `.then`. Below an example of how to handle promises and, more generally, asynchronous operations.\n\n```js\nconst promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  resolve('Success!')\n})\n\nconsole.log(await promise1)\n// Expected output: \"Success!\"\n\npromise1.then(value => {\n  console.log(value)\n  // Expected output: \"Success!\"\n})\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Introducing asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)\n- [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)\n- [Using promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)\n- [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)\n- [then](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)\n",

The goal is to bring them to the room `##end` with as few moves as possible.\n- The shortest path is not necessarily the simplest.\n- Some colonies will have many rooms and many links, but no path between `##start` and `##end`.\n- Some will have rooms that link to themselves, sending your path-search spinning in circles. Some will have too many/too few ants, no `##start` or `##end`, duplicated rooms, links to unknown rooms, rooms with invalid coordinates and a variety of other invalid or poorly-formatted input. In those cases the program will return an error message `ERROR: invalid data format`. If you wish, you can elaborate a more specific error message (example: `ERROR: invalid data format, invalid number of Ants` or `ERROR: invalid data format, no start room found`).\n\nYou must display your results on the standard output in the following format :\n\n```console\nnumber_of_ants\nthe_rooms\nthe_links\n\nLx-y Lz-w Lr-o ...\n```\n\n- x, z, r represents the ants numbers (going from 1 to number_of_ants) and y, w, o represents the rooms names.\n\n- A room is defined by `\"name coord_x coord_y\"`, and will usually look like `\"Room 1 2\", \"nameoftheroom 1 6\", \"4 6 7\"`.\n\n- The links are defined by `\"name1-name2\"` and will usually look like `\"1-2\", \"2-5\"`.\n\nHere is an example of this in practice :\n\n```\n##start\n1 23 3\n2 16 7\n#comment\n3 16 3\n4 16 5\n5 9 3\n6 1 5\n7 4 8\n##end\n0 9 5\n0-4\n0-6\n1-3\n4-3\n5-2\n3-5\n#another comment\n4-2\n2-1\n7-6\n7-2\n7-4\n6-5\n```\n\nWhich corresponds to the following representation :\n\n```console\n        _________________\n       /                 \\\n  ____[5]----[3]--[1]     |\n /            |    /      |\n[6]---[0]----[4]  /       |\n \\   ________/|  /        |\n  \\ /        [2]/________/\n  [7]_________/\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\n- You need to create tunnels and rooms.\n- A room will never start with the letter `L` or with `#` and must have no spaces.\n- You join the rooms together with as many tunnels as you need.\n- A tunnel joins only two rooms together never more than that.\n- A room can be linked to multiple rooms.\n- Two rooms can't have more than one tunnel connecting them.\n- Each room can only contain one ant at a time (except at `##start` and `##end` which can contain as many ants as necessary).\n- Each tunnel can only be used once per turn.\n- To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path or paths. They will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their fellow ants.\n- You will only display the ants that moved at each turn, and you can move each ant only once and through a tunnel (the room at the receiving end must be empty).\n- The rooms names will not necessarily be numbers, and in order.\n- Any unknown command will be ignored.\n- The program must handle errors carefully. In no way can it quit in an unexpected manner.\n- The coordinates of the rooms will always be `int`.\n- Your project must be written in **Go**.\n- The code must respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md).\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).\n\n### Allowed packages\n\n- Only the [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed.\n\n### Usage\n\nExample 1 :\n\n```\n$ go run . test0.txt\n3\n##start\n1 23 3\n2 16 7\n3 16 3\n4 16 5\n5 9 3\n6 1 5\n7 4 8\n##end\n0 9 5\n0-4\n0-6\n1-3\n4-3\n5-2\n3-5\n4-2\n2-1\n7-6\n7-2\n7-4\n6-5\n\nL1-3 L2-2\nL1-4 L2-5 L3-3\nL1-0 L2-6 L3-4\nL2-0 L3-0\n$\n```\n\nExample 2 :\n\n```\n$ go run . test1.txt\n3\n##start\n0 1 0\n##end\n1 5 0\n2 9 0\n3 13 0\n0-2\n2-3\n3-1\n\nL1-2\nL1-3 L2-2\nL1-1 L2-3 L3-2\nL2-1 L3-3\nL3-1\n$\n```\n\nExample 3 :\n\n```\n$ go run . test1.txt\n3\n2 5 0\n##start\n0 1 2\n##end\n1 9 2\n3 5 4\n0-2\n0-3\n2-1\n3-1\n2-3\n\nL1-2 L2-3\nL1-1 L2-1 L3-2\nL3-1\n$\n```\n\n### Bonus\n\n- As a bonus you can create an ant farm visualizer that shows the ants moving trough the colony.\n\n  - Here is an usage example : `./lem-in ant-farm.txt | ./visualizer`\n\n  - The coordinates of the room will be useful only here.\n\nThis project will help you learn about :\n\n- Algorithmic\n- Ways to receive data\n- Ways to output data\n- Manipulation of strings\n- Manipulation of structures\n",

Above all, Linus wanted one that looked happy, as if it had just polished off a pitcher of beer and then had the best sex of its life.\"\n>\n> _Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary_ (Linus Torvalds, David Diamond)\n\n---\n\nThis series of projects will introduce you to a Linux distribution called Debian and its use in servers (always-on computers providing the required services for Internet and applications).\n\nYou'll become a better programmer by knowing what's underneath your programs and what's behind Cloud services.\n\nIt will also allow you to learn some tricks to better control your machine and servers.\n\n### Virtualization\n\nTo practice in a standardized manner and without the risk of altering your own operating system, you should install a virtualization software that is compatible with your chip architecture.\n\nFor X86-64 chips, we recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). For Apple Silicon chips, we recommend using [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/).\n\nThis allows you to run virtual machines - virtual computers accessible through a window. This way, you can run Linux, Windows, and macOS in separate windows at the same time, regardless of your operating system.\n\n### Installation\n\n### Installation\n\nOperating systems are usually installed with a \"disk image\" that can be written to a USB stick or CD/DVD for installation on a computer, or kept as is for installation in a virtual machine (which is the case here).\n\nInstall Debian (ISO installer \"netinst\" is recommended) in a VM (Virtual Machine). The steps are :\n\n- Create the VM.\n- Start the VM and attach the ISO file as an optical drive (CD/DVD).\n- Follow the steps of the installer, it will reboot with a Debian system ready to use.\n\n### Shut down\n\nclose the VM using the command line after login in the console\n",

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol was created in order to ensure a reliable way to communicate on a request/response base.\n\nThis protocol is used by servers and clients (usually browsers) to serve content and it is the backbone of the World Wide Web, still it is also used in many other cases that are far beyond the scope of this exercise.\n\nHere you will learn the basics of the protocol and a good place to start could be the [HTTP/1.1 RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html).\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n- The project must be written in `Rust`.\n- You can use the `libc` crate for functions as `epoll` or equivalents and any other necessary system call that Rust do not implement natively.\n- You may need to use `unsafe` keyword for some operations (don't abuse it).\n\n> You can't use crates that already implement server features like `tokio` or `nix`.\n\n#### The Server\n\nYou goal is to write your very own server, which will use `HTTP` protocol to serve static web pages to browsers.\n\nFor your server you must guarantee the following behavior:\n- It **never** crashes.\n- All requests timeout if they are taking too long.\n- It can listen on multiple ports and instantiate multiple servers at the same time.\n- You use only one process and one thread.\n- It receives a request from the browser/client and send a response using the `HTTP` header and body.\n- It is compatible with `HTTP/1.1` protocol.\n- You can compare your results with `NGINX` which will be used as the reference.\n- It is compatible with the last version of your chosen browser.\n- It manages at least [`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`] methods.\n- It is able to receive file uploads made by the client.\n- It handles cookies and sessions.\n- You should create default error pages for at least the following error codes [400,403,404,405,413,500].\n- It calls `epoll` function (or equivalent) only once for each client/server communication.\n- All reads and writes should pass by `epoll` or equivalent API.\n- All I/O operations should be non-blocking.\n- You should manage chunked and unchunked requests.\n- You should set the right status for each response.\n\n#### The CGI\n- Based on the file extension the server will execute the corresponding `CGI` (for example `.php` or `.py`).\n- You need to implement only one `CGI` of your choice.\n- You are allowed to fork a new process to run the `CGI`.\n- `CGI` expects the file to process as first argument and `EOF` as end of the body.\n- Pay attention to the directory where the `CGI` will run for correct relative paths handling.\n- The `CGI` will check `PATH_INFO` environment variable to define the full path.\n\t\n#### Configuration File\n\nIn the file you should be able to specify the following:\n\n- The host (server_address) and one or multiple ports for each server.\n- The first server for a host:port will be the default if the \"server_name\" didn't match any other server.\n- Path to custom error pages.\n- Limit client body size for uploads.\n- Setup routes with one or multiple of the following settings:\n  - Define a list of accepted HTTP methods for the route.\n  - Define HTTP redirections.\n  - Define a directory or a file from where the file should be searched (for example, if `/test` is rooted to `/usr/Desktop`, the URL `/test/my_page.html` will route to `/usr/Desktop/my_page.html`).\n  - Define a default file for the route if the URL is a directory.\n  - Specify a `CGI` to use for a certain file extension.\n  - Turn on or off directory listing.\n  - Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory.\n- No need to manage comments \"(#)\".\n\n> Routes won't need to support regular expressions.\n\n> There is no need to pass through `epoll` when reading the configuration file.\n\n#### Testing your server\n- Do stress tests with `siege -b [IP]:[PORT]`, it must stay available at all costs (availability should be up to 99.5, it will be tested during audits).\n- Create tests for as many cases as you can (redirections, bad configuration files, static and dynamic pages, default error pages and so on).\n- You will be requested to provide and explain your tests during the audits.\n- You can use the language you prefer to write tests, as long as they are exhaustive and the auditor can check their behavior.\n- Test possible memory leaks before to submit the project.\n- Once again, the server should never crash and never leak memory.\n\n> Attention: `siege` is a stressing tool, use it ONLY to test your own server. Do **NEVER** use it on any server/website without the owner's permission. If you do so you would have illegally DDoSed a server and could face serious troubles.\n\n### Bonus\n- Handle at least one more `CGI`.\n- Rewrite the project in another programming language (can be `C++` or `C`).\n",

      "full_content": "## make-your-game\n\nWith the passing of time and evolution of technology, the human brain has been requesting\nmore and more stimuli to keep the brain occupied. Boredom happens whenever\npeople don't receive enough of these stimuli. And you are not receiving enough\nof it, so you decide to make **your own game**. And to make it more challenging you decide to use\nJavaScript to make it.\n\nYour game will be single player only and you will have to create your\nown engine and tools for the game. And as you try to search for all sorts\nof information you start to remember all the 60 FPS memes.\n\n![59fps meme](resources/59fps.jpeg)\n\n### Objectives\n\nHere are some of the features you want to implement in your game:\n\n- Game runs at at least **60 FPS** at all times\n- No frame drops!\n- Proper use of **RequestAnimationFrame**\n- It is very hard to predict performances in JS. So measure performances to see if your code is fast. This will be tested!\n- Pause menu, that includes:\n  - Continue\n  - Restart\n- A score board that displays the following metrics:\n  - **Countdown clock or Timer** that will indicate the amount of time the player has until the game ends or the time that the game has been running\n  - **Score** that will display the current score (XP or points)\n  - **Lives** that shows the number of lives that the player has left\n- The use of layers must be minimal but not zero in order to optimize the rendering performance.\n\nYou must not use frameworks or canvas, the game must be implemented using plain JS/DOM and HTML only\n\n### Instructions\n\nAnimation must have consistent motion, so in order to have a smooth animation (without interruptions or so-called jank animation) you must achieve the special number, [**60 FPS**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-animation-performance-fundamentals/). You can see more about performance [here](../good-practices/README.md#game-performance)\n\nIn order to play the game the player must only use the keyboard. The controls must be smooth, in other words you should not need to spam a key to take actions in the game. Instead, for example, if a key is kept pressed, the player must continue to do the relevant action. If the key is released the player should stop doing the action.\n\nBasically, motions triggered by a key must not jank or stutter.\n\nFor the pause menu you must be able to pause, restart, and continue the game whenever you want to do so. The frames should not drop if paused.\n\n### Pre-Approved List\n\nYour game will have to respect the genre of one of these games listed below. In other words, the main goal of the game has to be similar to one of these:\n\n- [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bomberman)\n- [Flipper/ Pinball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball)\n- [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)\n- [Donkey Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong)\n- [Brick Breaker/ Arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid)\n- [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)\n- [Super Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario)\n- [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)\n- [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt)\n\n### Dev Tools\n\nWe strongly advise you to use Developer Tools available in every browser (can be accessed using hot keys that depend on the browser or from the browser's Tools menu option).\n\nDeveloper tools that will help the most with developing this project:\n\n- **Page Inspector**: You can view and edit page content and layout.\n- **Web Console**: You can see your `console.log`s and interact with the page using JavaScript.\n- **Performance Tool**: You can analyze your site's general responsiveness, performance, Javascript and layout performance.\n\nThe tool that will help you the most is the Performance Tool. There you can record a sample of your actions on the site and analyze the FPS, check for frame drops, how much time your functions take to execute, and other useful metrics monitoring.\n\nIn the developer tools you can also find a Paint Flashing option that will highlight every paint that happens in your page as actions are performed on it.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)\n- [Event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)\n- FPS\n- DOM\n- [Jank/stutter animation](https://addyosmani.com/blog/making-a-site-jank-free/)\n  - [Example](https://googlechrome.github.io/devtools-samples/jank/)\n- [Transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)/ [opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity)\n- Tasks\n  - JavaScript\n  - Styles\n  - Layout\n  - Painting\n  - Compositing\n- Developer Tools\n  - [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)\n  - [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)\n",

You can use `derive`.\n\n> Remember that you are defining a library, so any element that can be called from an external crate must be made public.\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a possible program to test your function\n\n```rust\nuse matrix_transposition::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let matrix = Matrix((1, 3), (4, 5));\n    println!(\"Original matrix {:?}\", matrix);\n    println!(\"Transpose matrix {:?}\", transpose(matrix));\n}\n```\n\nAnd its output:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\nOriginal matrix Matrix((1, 3), (4, 5))\nTranspose matrix Matrix((1, 4), (3, 5))\n$\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Defining a struct](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html)\n\n- [The Tuple Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type)\n\n- [Tuples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/primitives/tuples.html)\n\n- [Tuple Structs without Named Fields](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types)\n\n- [Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-02-example-structs.html#adding-useful-functionality-with-derived-traits)\n\n- [Referring to an Item in the Module Tree](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html)\n",

      "full_content": "## mini-framework\n\nNow that you have already used a framework of your choice, you must now implement some features on a framework of your own. That's right, you are going to create a framework.\n\nBe aware that a framework is different from a library. When you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.\n\n### Objectives\n\nYour framework should implement:\n\n- Abstracting the DOM\n- Routing System\n- State Management\n- Event Handling\n\nYou will also need to make a [todoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project using your framework.\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou must create documentation for your framework, so that users (auditors) are able to understand and know how to use your framework without experiencing any awkwardness.\n\nYour framework will be tested by using it, like you previously have used one, in the social network project. So the user has to be presented to a folder structure that allows him to run the app from the root of that folder structure. The user testing your framework will have to implement some simple code in order to test the features described below.\n\n> You are not allowed to use any framework/library like `React`, `Angular`, `Vue` and similar to create your own framework.\n\n#### Documentation\n\nBy documentation we mean, the explaining of how does the framework works and how to work with it, for example: how to create a div, how to add an event to a button, etc. A new user of your framework, after reading the documentation has to be able to use it without too much guessing work.\n\nSo for this you will have to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file, in which will have to contain:\n\n- Explanation on the features of your framework\n- Code examples and explanations on how to:\n  - Create an element\n  - Create an event\n  - Nest elements\n  - Add attributes to an element\n- Explanation on why things work the way they work\n\n#### Abstracting the DOM\n\nYou will have to implement a way to handle the DOM. The DOM can be seen as a big object, like in the example below:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <div class=\"nameSubm\">\n    <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Insert Name\" />\n    <input type=\"submit\" placeholder=\"Submit\" />\n  </div>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe HTML above can be written as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tag\": \"html\",\n  \"attrs\": {},\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"tag\": \"div\",\n      \"attrs\": {\n        \"class\": \"nameSubm\"\n      },\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"tag\": \"input\",\n          \"attrs\": {\n            \"type\": \"text\",\n            \"placeholder\": \"Insert Name\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"tag\": \"input\",\n          \"attrs\": {\n            \"type\": \"submit\",\n            \"placeholder\": \"Submit\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWith this in mind you can manipulate the DOM more easily in JS. And that is what you will do using a method. Here are some methods you can use:\n\n- [Virtual DOM](https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/) - Using a second DOM with the wanted changes, to compare with the real DOM and change just what is needed\n- [Data Binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop-wpf/data/data-binding-overview?redirectedfrom=MSDN) - binds together two data sources and keeps them synchronized\n- [Templating](https://medium.com/@BuildMySite1/javascript-templating-what-is-templating-7ff49d97db6b) - refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to achieve this. Above are just some examples, what matters is that the DOM must respond to certain actions of the user.\n\nYou have to take into account the events, children and attributes of each element of the DOM.\n\n---\n\n#### Routing System\n\nRouting in this case refers to the synchronization of the state of the app with the URL. In other words you will have to develop a simple way to change the URL through actions of the user that will also change the state (explained in the next topic).\n\n---\n\n#### State Management\n\nThe state of an app can be seen as the outcome of all the actions that the user has taken since the page loaded. In other words, if a user clicks on a button to execute an action, the state should then change.\\\nWhat you will need to do is to implement a way to handle this state. Remember that multiple pages may need to interact with the same state, so you need to find a way to let the state be reachable at every time.\n\n---\n\n#### Event Handling\n\nYou will also have to implement a way to handle the events triggered by the user, like: scrolling, clicking, certain keybindings, etc.... Note that this new way of handling events must be different from the `addEventListener()` method that already exists.\n\n---\n\n#### TodoMVC\n\nA todoMVC project consists of creating a [webpage](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/) (this example is written in React) with the same elements present in the example, so we advise you to test it around first. You have to make your todoMVC project, a functional copy of the examples given in the links above, but using your framework.\\\nBe aware that every thing that we can't visually see has to be present too (IDs, classes, etc.).\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- Web Development\n  - JS\n  - HTML\n  - CSS\n- Frameworks\n- Documentation\n- DOM\n- Routing\n- State of an Application\n- Event Handling\n",

Well you are not going to play it this time yet. But after finishing this project, you will be able to.\n\nYou will have to continue to build a quiz game website that is already in development. The already made code is available [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/mister-quiz/mister_quiz.zip). There is missing some code that you will have to create in order to fullfil all the requests explained in the `Instructions` section.\n\nThe project is written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and it is using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), one of the most (if not the most) known PHP web framework. So you have to install both PHP and Laravel on your machine (you can use which [method](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#getting-started-on-linux) you like the best). Get comfortable using dollar signs.\n\n### Instructions\n\nFirstly, users should be able to register and login. To register a user has to enter a username, an email, a password and a password confirmation. To login the user has to provide the email and the password. If the login credentials are not correct, an error message should appear.\n\nIn the Login page, it must be possible to navigate to the Registration page, and vice versa.\n\nThe user must have in its attributes the amount of XP, determined by the number of questions he or she answered right. Also the score for each category of questions should be stored in the format `x/y` where `x` are the correct answers and `y` are the total questions.\n\nAfter logging in the user should be redirected to the homepage. The homepage should have at least three buttons present, four if they are\nlogged in:\n\n- The Login button / Profile button => if the user is not logged in, the login button should be visible, otherwise the profile button must be visible.\n- The Leaderboard button => shows a list of the best players.\n- The Start Quiz button => button that when pressed starts a quiz.\n- The Logout button => Is only shown if the user is logged in.\n\n#### Quiz\n\nWhen clicking the `Start Quiz` button on the homepage, if the user is not logged in, the user should be redirected to the Login page (instead of starting the quiz). In case the user is already logged in, the website must present the questions and the available answers for each question. The player can then choose an answer to each question and at the bottom of all the questions submit the quiz and get his results.\n\nA question has:\n\n- the question text\n- a category. The available categories must be:\n  - Art\n  - History\n  - Geography\n  - Science\n  - Sports\n- XP\n\nThere are some conditions that you should have in account:\n\n- After starting the quiz, if the user refreshes the page the same questions should pop up.\n  - The same must happen if the user goes back to the homepage and start the quiz again.\n- All questions should have been answered before being able to submit the quiz.\n- At least one question of each category is required.\n\nAfter submitting the quiz, the user should be presented to a `Results` page. This page must show:\n\n- How many questions the user answered right and the number of total questions made\n- How many questions the user answered right in each category\n\nIf a user gets a correct answer to a question, his XP is increased by the XP of the question he answered right. Also the score that the user has for the category of that question should be updated.\n\n#### Profile\n\nWhen the user visits his profile the following must be visible:\n\n- his username\n- his email\n- his XP\n- his rank (dependent on the amount of XP):\n  - < 1500 XP => Quiz Aprentice\n  - 1500 XP - 5000 XP => Average Quizer\n  - 5000 XP - 10000 XP => Epic Quizer\n  - \\>= 10000 XP => Quiz Master\n- the percentage of correct answers for each category\n- number of correct answers for each category\n- number of total questions answered for each category\n\nOnly the user should be able to see his own profile.\n\n#### Leaderboard\n\nThe leaderboard page should display a table containing the top 10 players organized by XP amount. Each row of the table must have:\n\n- username\n- XP amount\n- total correct answers\n\n#### Laravel\n\nIf you already opened the project zip file provided, you might have been surprised with the amount of files and folders inside it. We know, it can be overwhelmeing.\n\nHere are the main folders and files you will mess around with:\n\n- `app/`\n  - `Http/Controllers/` -> is the folder of every Controller in Laravel. A Controller is what controls the backend for a specific route.\n  - `Models/` -> refers to the models/ classes that are used in the app.\n- `database/migrations/` -> here are located the migrations that refer to the database.\n- `public/` -> is the folder that applies CSS, JS, images, etc. to the website.\n- `resources/views/` -> refers to the folder containing every view for the different pages of the website. You will notice that the files inside it have the extension `.blade.php`. This extension is used by Laravel to write HTML together with PHP. You can learn more about [Blade Templates](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/blade) in the web.\n- `routes/web.php` -> is the file responsible for the routes in the website.\n\nOf course there are a lot more folders and files available that can help you achieve the idea that you have in mind for the website, but it is up to you to research them.\n\nYou can take advantage of the templates and design provided in the resource zip file provided, or you can choose to implement your own design ideas, as long as the project requirements are respected.\n\nYou may use some commands to, for example, create controllers, create migrations, apply migrations, etc. The options are endless. You will notice that in the root directory of the project there is a file `artisan`. Try running `php artisan` on the root folder of a Laravel project and you will see every command available for you.\n\n#### Database\n\nIn order to apply the migrations in the `database/migrations/` directory, you will need to create a database. Shocker.\n\nOne of the ways to accomplish that is to work with [`XAMPP`](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment and unites useful tools in order to make web development easier. It pretty much uses Apache2 (an http web server host), MySQL (a database management service) and phpMyAdmin (a web MySQL administration app).\n\nOnce you have XAMPP and these three tools up and running, you can head over to [`localhost/phpmyadmin`](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) and create a new database called mister_quiz. After that you apply the migrations and you are good to go on your quiz quest.\n\n> [Here](https://assets.01-edu.org/mister-quiz/questions_and_answers.sql) is a sql file in which you can run in phpMyAdmin in order to have some data (questions and answers) for you to work with. You can also come up with your own questions and answers.\n\nWhen first trying to run the project you will notice that you can in fact run it and go to the web page, but you will not be able to do much more. This is where you come in and save the day (or week depending on how much time you will take to solve this project).\n",

It should accept a tuple with the member's information, `name` and `age` (`(&str, u32)`). The member's role should be set to the lowest one, `Associate`.\n- `attack`: a method which receives another `Mob` as reference. It will remove the youngest member(s) from the `members` from whichever mob has the least power combat score. In the case of a draw, the attacker loses. Furthermore, if the loser is left with zero members, the victorious mob will **also** take the cities and wealth from the losing mob. The power combat score is calculated from the sum of the `role` of each mob `member`:\n  - `Underboss`: 4\n  - `Caporegime`: 3\n  - `Soldier`: 2\n  - `Associate`: 1\n- `steal`: a method which receives a `Mob` to target, and a `u64` value to steal. The `self` mob steals the value from the wealth of the target mob, and adds the value to its own wealth. Naturally, any mob can only be stolen as much money as they have in possession.\n- `conquer_city`: a method which receives a slice of references of `Mob`, and a `String` city name. The city is added to its list of cities if none of the other mobs already have it.\n\nYou will also need to create two submodules:\n\n- `boss`: which should contain:\n  - `Boss`: a struct which consists of:\n  - `name`: `String`\n  - `age`: `u32`\n  - `new`: an associated function which accepts a `name: &str` and `age: u32`, and returns a `Boss`.\n- `member` submodule which consists of:\n\n  - `Role`: an enum with the variants:\n    - `Underboss`\n    - `Caporegime`\n    - `Soldier`\n    - `Associate`\n  - `Member`: a struct which consists of:\n\n    - `role`: `Role`\n    - `age`: `u32`\n\n    - `get_promotion`: a method which when invoked should promote the member from:\n      - `Associate` -> `Soldier`\n      - `Soldier` -> `Caporegime`\n      - `Caporegime` -> `Underboss`\n      - `Underboss` -> Impossibility. Panic.\n\nWe advise you to have each submodule inside their own respective file, but that is up to you.\n\nEvery data structure should derive at least `Debug` and `PartialEq`.\n\n### Expected Function\n\n> You'll need to work out the function signatures for yourself.\n\n### Usage\n\n> You'll need to create your own tests and samples. Make sure you cover every possibility!\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Packages, Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html)\n",

You should recreate all the elements of the game, but you have freedom to implement the user interface.\n\n### Objectives\n\n#### User Interface\n\nThe game should present a specific User Interface, in which the minimum requirements are:\n\n- A mini map where the player can see his own position and the whole \"game world\".\n- The graphics of the game (walls and other players) should be similar to the original game (see [maze_wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V5X5SbSjns) for more details)\n- Finally you have to display the frame rate of the game on the screen.\n\n#### Architecture\n\n- Implement a client-server architecture where clients connect to a central server to play the game.\n- Your implementation should allow one client and the server to run on the same machine, with other clients connecting from different machines.\n- Use the UDP protocol to enable the communication between the clients and the server.\n- The game should have at least 3 levels with increasing difficulty (with difficulty we mean, making the maze harder, with more dead ends).\n\nYou will have to develop the game server and also a client application:\n\n- The server must accept as many connections as possible (the minimum should be 10).\n- When the client is initialized, the game should ask for:\n  - The IP address of the server, allowing the client application to connect to any server.\n  - A username for identification.\n\nAfter providing the above information, the game should start and open the graphical interface, allowing the player to join and start playing the game.\n\nExample:\nAssuming that you can connect to a server in the same computer.\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\nEnter IP Address: 198.1.1.34:34254\nEnter Name: name\nStarting...\n$\n```\n\n#### Performance\n\nThe game should always have a frame rate above 50 fps (frames per second).\n\n### Bonus\n\nAs bonus for this project here are some ideas:\n\n- Implement a level editor to allow players to create their own mazes.\n- Implement an algorithm that generates automatically new mazes.\n- Implement A.I. players to allow playing the game without having to wait for more people to join to the server.\n- For the basic implementation you can initialize the game from the command line. As a bonus you can implement the initialization of the game as part of the graphical interface and save a history of the hosts with an alias so it's easier to reconnect to known servers.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- GUI applications\n- Game mechanics\n- [UDP protocol](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol)\n",

Now, let's get into the issue. Let's paint the door of\n`mainHouse` in `red`.\n\n```js\nmainHouse.door = 'red'\n```\n\nIf we `console.log` both `mainHouse` and `sameHouse` we will now obtain:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(mainHouse) // { door: 'red', rooms: 3}\nconsole.log(sameHouse) // { door: 'red', rooms: 3}\n```\n\nBut wait a second... we just wanted to paint the door of `mainHouse`. What\nhappened here? Why are both doors painted in red?\n\nWell, unlike primitives that can not changes, _(the number `1` will always be\nthe number `1`)_ objects can mutate.\n\nYou can add, delete and update properties, so if two different variables are\nassigned to the same object value, they will both mutate the same object.\n\nWe call that a reference, not a copy.\n\nThere are multiple ways to copies objects. Understanding the limitations of each\nof these ways is very important. Which is why this time, you will have to do a\nbit of research...\n\n### Instructions\n\nWe will declare the same `mainHouse` seen in the lesson above.\n\n- Declare `acidHouse` which will be a `shallow copy` of `mainHouse`.\n- Declare `deepHouse` which will be a `deep copy` of `mainHouse`.\n\n> Not in my house! \\\n> ― Dikembe Mutombo\n",

It is used for anything involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets, it is able to open TCP connections, send UDP packages, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports and many more.\n\n- To see more information about NetCat inspect the manual `man nc`.\n\nYour project must work in a similar way that the original NetCat works, in other words, you must create a group chat. The project must have the following features :\n\n- TCP connection between server and multiple clients (relation of 1 to many).\n- A name requirement to the client.\n- Control connections quantity.\n- Clients must be able to send messages to the chat.\n- Do not broadcast EMPTY messages from a client.\n- Messages sent, must be identified by the time that was sent and the user name of who sent the message, example : `[2020-01-20 15:48:41][client.name]:[client.message]`\n- If a Client joins the chat, all the previous messages sent to the chat must be uploaded to the new Client.\n- If a Client connects to the server, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client joined the group.\n- If a Client exits the chat, the rest of the Clients must be informed by the server that the Client left.\n- All Clients must receive the messages sent by other Clients.\n- If a Client leaves the chat, the rest of the Clients must not disconnect.\n- If there is no port specified, then set as default the port 8989. Otherwise, program must respond with usage message: `[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port`\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Your project must be written in **Go**\n- Start TCP server, listen and accept connections\n- Your project must have Go-routines\n- Your project must have channels or Mutexes\n- Maximum 10 connections\n- The code must respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md)\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test) both the server connection and the client.\n\n- You have to be able to handle the errors from server side and client side\n\n### Allowed Packages\n\n- io\n- log\n- os\n- fmt\n- net\n- sync\n- time\n- bufio\n- errors\n- strings\n- reflect\n\n### Usage\n\n```console\n$ go run .\nListening on the port :8989\n$ go run . 2525\nListening on the port :2525\n$ go run . 2525 localhost\n[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port\n$\n```\n\n- You should answer the client with a linux logo and ask for their name, when connection is received\n\n```console\n$ nc $IP $port\nWelcome to TCP-Chat!\n         _nnnn_\n        dGGGGMMb\n       @p~qp~~qMb\n       M|@||@) M|\n       @,----.JM|\n      JS^\\__/  qKL\n     dZP        qKRb\n    dZP          qKKb\n   fZP            SMMb\n   HZM            MMMM\n   FqM            MMMM\n __| \".        |\\dS\"qML\n |    `.       | `' \\Zq\n_)      \\.___.,|     .'\n\\____   )MMMMMP|   .'\n     `-'       `--'\n[ENTER YOUR NAME]:\n```\n\n- Accept connection with non-empty name\n\nThe client :\n\n```console\n$ nc $IP $port\n```\n\nServer:\n\n```console\n$ go run . 2525\nListening on the port :2525\n```\n\nClient1 (Yenlik):\n\n```console\n$ nc localhost 2525\nWelcome to TCP-Chat!\n         _nnnn_\n        dGGGGMMb\n       @p~qp~~qMb\n       M|@||@) M|\n       @,----.JM|\n      JS^\\__/  qKL\n     dZP        qKRb\n    dZP          qKKb\n   fZP            SMMb\n   HZM            MMMM\n   FqM            MMMM\n __| \".        |\\dS\"qML\n |    `.       | `' \\Zq\n_)      \\.___.,|     .'\n\\____   )MMMMMP|   .'\n     `-'       `--'\n[ENTER YOUR NAME]: Yenlik\n[2020-01-20 16:03:43][Yenlik]:hello\n[2020-01-20 16:03:46][Yenlik]:How are you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:10][Yenlik]:\nLee has joined our chat...\n[2020-01-20 16:04:15][Yenlik]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:32][Lee]:Hi everyone!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:32][Yenlik]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:35][Lee]:How are you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:35][Yenlik]:great, and you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:41][Yenlik]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:44][Lee]:good!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:44][Yenlik]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:50][Lee]:alright, see ya!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:50][Yenlik]:bye-bye!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:57][Yenlik]:\nLee has left our chat...\n[2020-01-20 16:04:59][Yenlik]:\n```\n\nClient2 (Lee):\n\n```console\n$ nc localhost 2525\nYenliks-MacBook-Air:simpleTCPChat ybokina$ nc localhost 2525\nYenliks-MacBook-Air:simpleTCPChat ybokina$ nc localhost 2525\nWelcome to TCP-Chat!\n         _nnnn_\n        dGGGGMMb\n       @p~qp~~qMb\n       M|@||@) M|\n       @,----.JM|\n      JS^\\__/  qKL\n     dZP        qKRb\n    dZP          qKKb\n   fZP            SMMb\n   HZM            MMMM\n   FqM            MMMM\n __| \".        |\\dS\"qML\n |    `.       | `' \\Zq\n_)      \\.___.,|     .'\n\\____   )MMMMMP|   .'\n     `-'       `--'\n[ENTER YOUR NAME]: Lee\n[2020-01-20 16:03:43][Yenlik]:hello\n[2020-01-20 16:03:46][Yenlik]:How are you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:15][Lee]:Hi everyone!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:32][Lee]:How are you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:35][Lee]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:41][Yenlik]:great, and you?\n[2020-01-20 16:04:41][Lee]:good!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:44][Lee]:alright, see ya!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:50][Lee]:\n[2020-01-20 16:04:57][Yenlik]:bye-bye!\n[2020-01-20 16:04:57][Lee]:^C\n```\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Clients can change their names.\n- The chat group is informed when a Client changes their name.\n- Creating more than 1 group chat.\n- Implement more `NetCat` flags.\n- Terminal UI (you are allowed to use only this package : https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui).\n- Find a way to create and save all the logs into a file.\n\nThis project will help you learn about :\n\n- Manipulation of structures.\n- [Net-Cat](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/nc.1.html)\n- TCP/UDP\n  - TCP/UDP connection\n  - TCP/UDP socket\n- [Go concurrency](https://golang.org/doc/#go_concurrency_patterns)\n  - [Channels](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2)\n  - [Goroutines](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1)\n- Mutexes\n- IP and [ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)\n",

And while you are at it, home cleaning would be quite handy. Well, in this project you will help create a website in which all of this and more will be possible.\n\nThis website is still in the creation process, so not all features are available. You are going to implement some of the missing features.\n\nYou should also know that the website is being created in Django, a Python framework for web development. You can learn more about this framework in its own [website](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Yes, you will be messing around with Python, so be aware of the indentation. Also, you will need to know that this project was build in the version `v3.1.14` of Django, so if you have problems to run this project, please check your current version of Django and make the necessary changes in order to get the project to run.\n\n### Instructions\n\nThe website should contain two types of users:\n\n- Company: that can create new services\n- Customer: that can request existing services\n\nBoth users should be able to register and login. In order to login, users should enter the email and the password to do so. However, to register, each type of user has to provide different information:\n\n- Customer:\n  - email\n  - password\n  - password confirmation\n  - username\n  - date of birth\n- Company:\n  - email\n  - password\n  - password confirmation\n  - username\n  - field of work\n\n> Each user should have a unique email and username. So while registering a user should be alerted if the email and/or username has already been registered.\n\nEvery user should have his own profile page in which their information should be displayed (apart from the password, obviously). And, in case the user is a customer, all previous requested services have to be displayed as well. In case of a company profile, along with all their information, should also be present the services it provides.\n\nThe `field of work` attribute in the companies will restrict the kind of services it can provide. The `field of work` attribute should only accept these values:\n\n- Air Conditioner\n- All in One\n- Carpentry\n- Electricity\n- Gardening\n- Home Machines\n- Housekeeping\n- Interior Design\n- Locks\n- Painting\n- Plumbing\n- Water Heaters\n\nA `Carpentry` company can only create carpentry services as a `Housekeeping` company can only provide housekeeping services. However, the `All in One` companies can create any kind of services. But what does a service include? A service must have:\n\n- name\n- description\n- field (can have the same categories of fields as the companies, except you can not have an All in One service)\n- price per hour\n- date it was created (this attribute should automatically take a value when creating a service)\n\nThe website should have a page displaying the most requested services. There should also be a page showing every service in creation order (last created first) and a page for every service category, which displays the services available for that category.\n\nEvery service should have its own page, in which should be displayed the above information and also the company name that provides this service. A user should be able to check every service from that company by clicking on the name displayed and seeing the company profile.\n\nOnce a service is created by a company, every user has access to it. Only customers can request a service by providing the `address` where the service is required and the `service time` (in hours) needed for the service to be completed. Once a customer requires a service, it gets added to the list of previously requested services. In this list, for each service requested, the customer can see the service name, service field, calculated service cost, the date in which the service was requested and the company who provided the service.\n\nYou can check out this [video](https://youtu.be/GyRo3CUWQzE) to see what is expected from your project.\n\n#### Django\n\nNow, that you know what the project is about, we will explain you the file system architecture. A Django project is organized by a main folder of the project and different apps.\n\nWhen starting a new Django project (with the command `django-admin startproject <// name of project \\\\>`), the main folder (that has the same name of the project) and a file called `manage.py` get created. This file is used to run various commands. The most common ones are:\n\n- `python3 manage.py runserver` -> runs a server in the port 8000 by default, and serves your project to it.\n- `python3 manage.py startapp <// name of app \\\\>` -> creates an app, in other words, creates a directory with most of the needed files for an app.\n- `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate` -> these two commands are always hand in hand with each other. We use them to declare any changes made to the Django database (usually made in the `models.py` file of each app).\n- `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` -> creates a super user (admin) that can access and change information in the Django database (accessible in the url `localhost:8000/admin`).\n- `python3 manage.py` -> to get a list of all the commands available.\n\n> You may note that we use the command `python3`. You could simply use the command `python` but you must have the 3.0 version or higher installed.\n\nEach app usually is linked to a different aspect of the project. For example, in this project, there are three apps:\n\n- services: handles the essential features related to services (service creation, services display, service request ...)\n- users: handles the essential features related to the users (user registration, user profile, user login ...)\n- main: handles the information that is common in all the project (home page, navigation bar, logout page ...)\n\nBy default, when starting an app, Django creates several files that are very useful to the development of a website. The ones in which we spend more time in are:\n\n- `models.py` -> where you can add objects and define their attributes to the Django database\n- `views.py` -> where you can manipulate the backend of a web page on the project\n\nIn addition to these two files, as a rule of thumb other files are manually created:\n\n- `urls.py` -> here you can specify the urls of your project and associate them to a view (from the `views.py` file), in order to display a web page. For example, the url `profile/` is associated to the view `views.ProfileView`)\n- `forms.py` -> here you can create your forms to use in your `views.py` file. For example, you can create a default login form to use in the `LoginView` (present in the `views.py` file).\n\nUsually we also create a folder where we can store templates (in HTML). This folder usually follows the following structure:\n\n```sh\nnetfix/                     # project directory\n  ⌊ users/                  # users app directory\n    ⌊ __pycache__/\n    ⌊ migrations/\n    ⌊ templates/            # users template directory\n      ⌊ users/\n        ⌊ login.html\n        ⌊ profile.html\n        ⌊ register.html\n        ⌊   ...\n    ⌊   ...\n    ⌊ urls.py\n    ⌊ views.py\n```\n\nYou will also use what it is known as `Django templates`, which is used inside of HTML files. It is a way of coding inside of HTML, allowing to go through objects passed in (for loop) or even make conditional verifications (if/else statement), amongst other cool stuff. To learn more about it, you can check the [Django templates documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/templates/).\n\nYou can get the code which is already done [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/netfix/netfix.zip). You may see that there are some code missing, both in HTML and Python files. Your task is to complete it so that the website works as explained above.\n\nA css file is already provided (in the path `netfix/static/css/style.css`), but do feel free to change it up and come up with your own design for your site. This also means that you can change the HTML already provided.\n\n> When first trying to run the project with the `python3 manage.py runserver` command, you will notice that you will get an error. You must start there, by defining the customer model.\n\n### Bonus\n\nAs bonus for this project there are a couple things you could do:\n\n- add a rating system, where customers could rate the services they have requested\n- add pages to the service list\n- feel free to implement your own bonus\n",

You have at your disposal a list of `int` values, two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a set of instructions.\n\nYou will have to write 2 programs:\n\n- **push-swap**, which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using push-swap instruction language that sorts integer arguments received.\n- **checker**, which takes integer arguments and reads instructions on the standard input. Once read, checker executes them and displays `OK` if integers are sorted. Otherwise, it will display `KO`.\n\nAs said before, you will have two stacks at your disposal. Your goal is to sort the stack `a`, that will contain the `int` values received, in ascending order, using both stacks and a set of instructions.\n\nThese are the instructions that you can use to sort the stack :\n\n- `pa` push the top first element of stack `b` to stack `a`\n- `pb` push the top first element of stack `a` to stack `b`\n- `sa` swap first 2 elements of stack `a`\n- `sb` swap first 2 elements of stack `b`\n- `ss` execute `sa` and `sb`\n- `ra` rotate stack `a` (shift up all elements of stack `a` by 1, the first element becomes the last one)\n- `rb` rotate stack `b`\n- `rr` execute `ra` and `rb`\n- `rra` reverse rotate `a` (shift down all elements of stack `a` by 1, the last element becomes the first one)\n- `rrb` reverse rotate `b`\n- `rrr` execute `rra` and `rrb`\n\n#### Example\n\n```console\nInit a and b :\n2\n1\n3\n6\n8\n5\n= =\na b\n---------------------------------------\nExec sa :\n1\n2\n3\n6\n8\n5\n= =\na b\n---------------------------------------\nExec pb pb pb :\n6 3\n8 2\n5 1\n= =\na b\n---------------------------------------\nExec rb :\n6 2\n8 1\n5 3\n= =\na b\n---------------------------------------\nExec rra and rrb (equivalent to rrr):\n5 3\n6 2\n8 1\n= =\na b\n---------------------------------------\nExec pa pa pa:\n1\n2\n3\n5\n6\n8\n= =\na b\n```\n\n#### The push-swap program\n\n- You have to write a program named push-swap, which will receive as an argument the stack `a` formatted as a list of integers. The first integer should be at the top of the stack.\n- The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack `a`, with the smallest number being at the top.\n- Instructions must be separated by a `\\n` and nothing else.\n- The goal is to sort the stack with the minimum possible number of operations.\n- In case of error, you must display `Error` followed by a `\\n` on the standard error. Errors are understood as: some arguments are not integers and/or there are duplicates.\n- If there are no arguments, the program does not display anything (0 instructions).\n\n```console\n$ ./push-swap \"2 1 3 6 5 8\"\npb\npb\nra\nsa\nrrr\npa\npa\n$ ./push-swap \"0 one 2 3\"\nError\n$ ./push-swap\n$\n```\n\n#### The checker program\n\n- You have to write a program named checker, which will get as an argument the stack `a` formatted as a list of integers. The first argument should be at the top of the stack (be careful about the order). If no argument is given, checker stops and displays nothing.\n- Checker will then read instructions on the standard input, each instruction will be followed by `\\n`. Once all the instructions have been read, checker will execute them on the stack received as an argument.\n- If after executing those instructions, stack `a` is actually sorted and `b` is empty, then checker must display \"OK\" followed by a `\\n` on the standard output. In every other case, checker must display \"KO\" followed by a `\\n` on the standard output.\n- In case of error, you must display Error followed by a `\\n` on the standard error. Errors include for example: some arguments are not integers, there are duplicates, an instruction do not exist and/or is incorrectly formatted.\n- In case of there are no arguments, the program displays nothing.\n\n```console\n$ ./checker \"3 2 1 0\"\nsa\nrra\npb\nKO\n$ echo -e \"rra\\npb\\nsa\\n\" | ./checker \"3 2 one 0\"\nError\n$ echo -e \"rra\\npb\\nsa\\nrra\\npa\"\nrra\npb\nsa\nrra\npa\n$ echo -e \"rra\\npb\\nsa\\nrra\\npa\" | ./checker \"3 2 1 0\"\nOK\n$ ./checker\n$\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Your project must be written in **Go**.\n- The code must respect the [**good practices**](../good-practices/README.md).\n- It is recommended to have **test files** for [unit testing](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test).\n- The first executable file must be named **checker** and the second **push-swap**.\n- You have to be able to handle the errors.\n\n### Allowed packages\n\n- Only the [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed\n\n### Usage\n\n```console\n$ ARG=\"4 67 3 87 23\"; ./push-swap \"$ARG\" | wc -l\n6\n$ ARG=\"4 67 3 87 23\"; ./push-swap \"$ARG\" | ./checker \"$ARG\"\nOK\n$\n```\n\nIf the program checker displays KO, it means that your **push-swap** came up with a list of instructions that does not sort the list.\n\nThis project will help you learn about :\n\n- the use of basic algorithms\n- the use of sorting algorithms\n- the use of stacks\n\n### Help\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm\n",

Well it's time to make one even better also using JS, private messages, real time actions, live sharing video and live screen sharing too. Well, maybe not the last two. To get things straight there is a list below of what you will have to do.\n\n### Objectives\n\nOn this project you will have to focus on a few points:\n\n- Registration and Login\n- Creation of posts\n  - Commenting posts\n- Private Messages\n\nAs you already did the first forum you can use part of the code, but not all of it. Your new forum will have five different parts:\n\n- **SQLite**, in which you will store data, just like in the [previous forum](../forum/README.md#Communication)\n- **Golang**, in which you will handle data and Websockets (Backend)\n- **Javascript**, in which you will handle all the Frontend events and clients Websockets\n- **HTML**, in which you will organize the elements of the page\n- **CSS**, in which you will stylize the elements of the page\n\nYou will have only one HTML file, so every change of page you want to do, should be handled in the Javascript. This can be called having a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).\n\n#### Registration and Login\n\nTo be able to use the new and upgraded forum users will have to register and login, otherwise they will only see the registration or login page. This is premium stuff. The registration and login process should take in consideration the following features:\n\n- Users must be able to fill a register form to register into the forum. They will have to provide at least:\n  - Nickname\n  - Age\n  - Gender\n  - First Name\n  - Last Name\n  - E-mail\n  - Password\n- The user must be able to connect using either the nickname or the e-mail combined with the password.\n- The user must be able to log out from any page on the forum.\n\n#### Posts and Comments\n\nThis part is pretty similar to the first forum. Users must be able to:\n\n- Create posts\n  - Posts will have categories as in the first forum\n- Create comments on the posts\n- See posts in a feed display\n  - See comments only if they click on a post\n\n#### Private Messages\n\nUsers will be able to send private messages to each other, so you will need to create a chat, where it will exist :\n\n- A section to show who is online/offline and able to talk to:\n\n  - This section must be organized by the last message sent (just like discord). If the user is new and does not present messages you must organize it in alphabetic order.\n  - The user must be able to send private messages to the users who are online.\n  - This section must be visible at all times.\n\n- A section that when clicked on the user that you want to send a message, reloads the past messages. Chats between users must:\n\n  - Be visible, for this you will have to be able to see the previous messages that you had with the user\n  - Reload the last 10 messages and when scrolled up to see more messages you must provide the user with 10 more, without spamming the scroll event. **Do not forget what you learned!! (`Throttle`, `Debounce`)**\n\n- Messages must have a specific format:\n  - A **`date`** that shows when the message was sent\n  - The **`user name`**, that identifies the user that sent the message\n\nAs it is expected, the messages should work in real time, in other words, if a user sends a message, the other user should receive the notification of the new message without refreshing the page. Again this is possible through the usage of WebSockets in backend and frontend.\n\n### Allowed Packages\n\n- All [standard go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed.\n- [Gorilla websocket](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket)\n- [sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)\n- [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)\n- [gofrs/uuid](https://github.com/gofrs/uuid) or [google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid)\n\n> You must not use any frontend libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, Vue etc.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- The basics of web :\n  - HTML\n  - HTTP\n  - [Sessions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-management-waf-protections) and [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n  - CSS\n  - Backend and Frontend\n  - DOM\n- [Go routines](https://golangbot.com/goroutines/)\n- [Go channels](https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-channels-in-go-concurrency-in-go-1ec336086adb)\n- [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket):\n  - Go Websockets\n  - JS Websockets\n- SQL language\n  - Manipulation of databases\n",

The Army of the Dead have finally fulfilled their oath. It is\nnow time to free them so that they may rest in peace.\n\nBut first we need to regroup and count them to make sure not one single soul is\nleft behind. We will provide a four variables of type array:\n\n- `swordMen`\n- `archers`\n- `captains`\n- `generals`\n\nYou will need to concat the content of `swordMen` and `archers` into one array\n`footSoldiers`. That batallion is lead by `'Grim the Terrible'`. He likes to\nscream to soldiers that walks too slow, so you need to put him as the last\nelement of the array.\n\nThen you will do the same for `captains` and `generals` into the array\n`horseMen`. That batallion is lead by `'The Skull Knight'`. He, on the other\nhand, likes to lead from the front. He needs to be the first element of the\narray.\n\nFinally you will do it one more time for `footSoldiers` and `horseMen` into the\narray `armyOfTheDead`. For having a better overview, `'The King of the Dead'`\nneeds to be tactically positioned in between his foot soldiers and his knights.\n\nOh! and here is a little detail, the methods `concat`, `push` and `unshift` were\ndamaged during the battle... so find another way.\n\nHurry, they are waiting...\n\n> Well, this is a thing unheard of. \\\n> An Elf would go underground, where a Dwarf dare not. \\\n> Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.! \\\n> ― Gimli\n",

You can display the objects in any way you wish.\n\n**1 Roads**\n\nYou will create two roads which cross each other to create an intersection. Each road will have **one lane** in each direction.\n\nTraffic entering the intersection will be able to select a route by:\n\n- turning left\n- turning right\n- continuing on straight\n\n```console\n                        North\n                    |  ↓  |  ↑  |\n                    |  ↓  |  ↑  |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n     _______________|     |     |_______________\n     ← ←                                     ← ←\nEast ---------------             --------------- West\n     → →                                     → →\n     _______________             _______________\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |     |     |\n                    |  ↓  |  ↑  |\n                    |  ↓  |  ↑  |\n                        South\n```\n\n**2 Traffic lights**\n\nTraffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections that follow a universal color code. We all know the normal colors for traffic lights, but for this exercise, your traffic lights will only have **red** and **green**.\n\nYou will position those traffic lights at the point where each lane enters the intersection.\n\nYou can implement any algorithm you choose to control the traffic lights system, but bear in mind that **traffic congestion should remain below the lane’s maximum capacity**.\n\n> **Dynamic Congestion Rule:**\n> The maximum allowed queue length for each lane is calculated based on the lane’s physical length, vehicle length, and safety gap between vehicles:\n>\n> ```\n> capacity = floor(lane_length / (vehicle_length + safety_gap))\n> ```\n>\n> Where:\n>\n> - `lane_length`: Distance from the stop line to the vehicle spawn point\n> - `vehicle_length`: Approximate car length in simulation units (e.g., pixels or meters)\n> - `safety_gap`: Minimum safe distance between vehicles\n>\n> If the number of vehicles in a lane reaches this capacity, the traffic light logic should adjust (e.g., extend green time for that lane) to prevent overflow.\n\nThe primary function of your traffic light system is to avoid collisions between vehicles passing through the intersection, while dynamically adapting to congestion.\n\n**3. Vehicles**\n\n```\n  ______\n /|_||_\\`.__\n=`-(_)--(_)-'\n```\n\nThe vehicles traveling through your capital city's new junction must follow these rules:\n\n- Vehicles must be painted in a color which illustrates the route they will follow. The colors are up to you to decide, and your choices will need to be made available during the audit of the raid. For example, all cars which make a right turn could be painted yellow. It's really up to you though.\n\n- It is not possible for the vehicle to change its selected route.\n\n- Each vehicle must have a fixed velocity.\n\n- A safety distance from other vehicles must be maintained. If one vehicle stops, the following vehicle must also stop before it gets too close to the stationary vehicle in front.\n\n- Vehicles must stop if the traffic light is red and proceed otherwise.\n\n- There are no other vehicle types with special privileges. You can consider that there are no emergency vehicles in your capital city.\n\n---\n\n#### **Commands**\n\nYou will use your keyboard to spawn vehicles for your simulation. You will use the arrow keys to spawn a vehicle on the appropriate side of the road, and with a random route.\n\n- **`↑` Up:** moves towards the intersection **from the south.**\n- **`↓` Down:** moves towards the intersection **from the north.**\n- **`→` Right:** moves towards the intersection **from the west.**\n- **`←` Left:** moves towards the intersection **from the east.**\n- **`r`:** moves towards the intersection **from a random direction.**\n- **`Esc` Escape:** ends the simulation.\n\n> It must not be possible to use the keyboard to spam the creation of vehicles; they must be created with a safe distance between them.\n\n> A safe distance is any distance which enables the vehicles to avoid crashing into each other.\n\n### Example\n\nYou can see an example for road_intersection [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0-ZBET6mo).\n\n### Bonus\n\nYou can implement the following optional features:\n\n- Vehicle and traffic light animations, and image rendering.

Numbers and punctuation should be left unchanged.\n\n### Expected functions\n\n```rust\npub fn rotate(input: &str, key: i8) -> String {\n    todo!()\n}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nHere is a program to test your function.\n\n```rust\nuse rot::*;\n\nfn main() {\n\n    println!(\"The letter \\\"a\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"a\", 26));\n    println!(\"The letter \\\"m\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"m\", 0));\n    println!(\"The letter \\\"m\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"m\", 13));\n    println!(\"The letter \\\"a\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"a\", 15));\n    println!(\"The word \\\"MISS\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"MISS\", 5));\n    println!(\n        \"The decoded message is: {}\",\n        rotate(\"Gur svir obkvat jvmneqf whzc dhvpxyl.\", 13)\n    );\n    println!(\n        \"The decoded message is: {}\",\n        rotate(\"Mtb vznhpqd ifky ozrunsl ejgwfx ajc\", 5)\n    );\n    println!(\n        \"Your cypher wil be: {}\",\n        rotate(\"Testing with numbers 1 2 3\", 4)\n    );\n    println!(\"Your cypher wil be: {}\", rotate(\"Testing\", -14));\n    println!(\"The letter \\\"a\\\" becomes: {}\", rotate(\"a\", -1));\n}\n```\n\nAnd its output:\n\n```console\n$ cargo run\nThe letter \"a\" becomes: a\nThe letter \"m\" becomes: m\nThe letter \"m\" becomes: z\nThe letter \"a\" becomes: p\nThe word \"MISS\" becomes: RNXX\nThe decoded message is: The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\nThe decoded message is: Ryg aesmuvi nkpd tewzsxq jolbkc foh\nYour cypher wil be: Xiwxmrk amxl ryqfivw 1 2 3\nYour cypher wil be: Fqefuzs\nThe letter \"a\" becomes: z\n$\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-patterns.html)\n",

It will have a store where the products will be saved, and a cart which will contain items from which a receipt will be generated.\n\n**\"Buy three, get one free\".**\n\nThe store is having a promotion. The cheapest of three items will be free. But there is a problem with the printer interface, it cannot receive any zero values. We can create a workaround. We will reduce all of the values in the cart by a small amount to show the correct total price. You can see the example to see how it works.\n\nYou will have to implement for the `Cart` structure the following **functions**:\n\n- `new`: that will initialize the cart.\n- `insert_item`: will receive a reference to `Store` and a `String`. Just like the name says, it will insert the item to the cart.\n- `generate_receipt`: returns a vector of sorted floats.

It should save the result in the `receipt` field.\n\n### Expected Function\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub struct Store {\n    pub products: Vec<(String, f32)>,\n}\nimpl Store {\n    pub fn new(products: Vec<(String, f32)>) -> Store {\n        Store { products }\n    }\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub struct Cart {\n    // expected public fields\n}\nimpl Cart {\n    pub fn new() -> Cart {}\n    pub fn insert_item(&mut self, s: &Store, ele: String) {}\n    pub fn generate_receipt(&mut self) -> Vec<f32> {}\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```\n[1.23, 3.12, 23.1]` => `[1.17, 2.98, 22.06]\n```\n\nBecause `1.17 + 2.98 + 22.06` == `0 + 3.12 + 23.1`\n\nFloats are rounded with a precision of two decimals which can create small discrepancies as per the example above.\n\nThis is a percentage calculation, and it can be applied to a set of three items.

      "full_content": "## rt\n\nThere are two ways to render a 3d scene into a 2d image: `rasterization`, which converts the shapes and geometric figures to pixels and applies calculations to obtain the color, the shadows, the refraction, etc... of those pixels. The other method is called `ray tracing` and consists in drawing each pixel with its color, shadows, refraction, reflection, etc.... already present from the start.\n\nImagine a camera pointing at a scene, and from that camera, a bunch of rays are coming, which bounce from object to object until they reach the light source (lamp, sun, etc...). This is basically how a ray tracer works.\n\nIn `ray tracing` each of these rays can be seen as a pixel in the image captured by the camera. Recursively the ray tracer will calculate where the light comes from in that pixel, allowing to give that pixel a color with some shadow aspect, some refraction aspect, and so on.\n\nTo understand better how ray tracing works, it is highly suggested that you search online this subject, as it can get quite complicated.\n\nBelow is an example of an image which your ray tracer should be able to produce:\n\n![image.png](raytrace.png)\n\n> The image generated includes reflection that is one of the required bonus features. More information below.\n\n### Objectives\n\nIn this project, you have to implement the ray tracer method in order to be able to render a computer generated image containing a few objects.\n\nWhen building your ray tracer, you have to take some points into consideration:\n\n- You need to be able to create at least 4 simple objects: a sphere, a cube, a flat plane and a cylinder.\n- Your program must be able to change an object's location before creating the image. (Example: render a sphere with its center on the point (1,1,1)).\n- You have to be able to look at the same scene from different angles by moving the camera/point of view.\n- You also have to implement simple light management, which includes: different brightness and shadows.\n\nAs your ray tracer will probably be a bit slow to render high resolution scenes, you should make 4 .ppm images for the auditors to evaluate. The scenarios of these 4 images that you have to create consist of:\n\n- A scene with a sphere;\n- A scene with a flat plane and a cube with lower brightness than in the sphere image;\n- A scene with one of each of all the objects (one cube, one sphere, one cylinder and one flat plane);\n- A scene like the previous one, but with the camera in another position (thus generating the same image from a different perspective).\n\nAll the images should be in the format of 800x600. However, while testing, you should use smaller resolution images in order to reduce your rendering time (a 1200x1000 can take up to 40 mins to create). It would be best to consider the possibility of changing the output image's resolution easily.\n\nAnother aspect you should consider is that the auditor will have to use your ray tracer, so make it as usable and optimized as possible. You should provide the auditor clear documentation.\n\n#### Documentation\n\nBy documentation, we mean the explanation of how the ray tracer works and how to work with it, for example: how to create an object, how to change brightness in a scene, etc... After reading the documentation, a new user of your ray tracer has to be able to use it without much guessing work.\n\nYou will have to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) file, which will have to contain:\n\n- Explanation on the features of your ray tracer\n- Code examples and explanations on how to:\n  - Create an instance of each object (a sphere, a cube, a flat plane and a cylinder)\n  - Change the brightness\n  - Change the camera position and angle\n\n### Instructions\n\nIn order to render images you will create a [.ppm](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~soni/cs35/f13/Labs/extras/01/ppm_info.html) file. A .ppm file consists of an image header and an image body. Example:\n\n```\nP3              \\\n4 4              > Image Header\n255             /\n0 0 0           \\\n0 0 0            \\\n0 0 0            |\n255 0 255        |\n100 0 0          |\n0 255 175        |\n0 0 0            |\n0 0 0             > Image Body\n0 0 0            |\n0 0 0            |\n015 175          |\n0 0 0            |\n255 0 255        |\n0 0 0            |\n0 0 0            /\n255 255 255     /\n```\n\nThe image header consists of three lines:\n\n- The first one is the image format: what type of PPM (full color, ASCII encoding) image it is. P3 stands for the Portable PixMap type, so you will be using this one.\n- The following stands for how many columns and rows of pixels the image will contain.\n- The third line is the maximum color value, 255 is the most common value since the rgb color code is very well known.\n\nAll the other lines below are the rgb values for each pixel, for example the first line of the image body represents a black pixel (rgb(0,0,0) -> black). Each line represents one pixel, starting on the top left corner transitioning to the right and, in this case, the fifth line is the pixel in the first row on the second column.\n\nSo with this in mind, you will have to make an algorithm that fills a file by printing each line. You can use the cargo command this way: `cargo run > output.ppm`. This will print the standard output to the file `output.ppm`.\n\nIn order to create the previously mentioned objects, you will need to search online for documentation about the geometrics of each.\n\n### Bonus\n\nAs bonus for this project you can implement:\n\n- Textures to the surfaces of the objects\n- Reflection and refraction effects on the objects (make them shiny or reflective)\n- Add particles\n- Add fluids\n\nConsider putting your bonuses behind command-line flags to achieve a reasonable performance standard defined above. For example, to render textures on your image, you can use a flag -t. Otherwise, textures will be ignored.\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [Ray Tracing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)>)\n- Computer generated imagery (CGI)\n- Algorithms\n- Geometry and maths\n",

Scan a network to find hosts\n2. Scan a host to get information (hardware, OS & exposed services)\n\n`1.` can be done by analyzing the link layer of Internet protocols, in particular `ARP` in order to gather MAC addresses (the identifier of a network interface, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet cards).\n\n`2.` is usually performed by analyzing the network and transport layers, in particular the `IP` & `TCP` protocols with the `nmap` tool.\n\nFor the context, when you open a website, here are the protocols involved, from the highest to lowest level (the protocols at the top depend on those at the bottom):\n\n- `HTTP`: application layer (website data) - messages\n- `TLS`: application layer (\"lock\" sign) - secure connection\n- `TCP`: transport layer (port number) - reliable connection\n- `IP`: network layer (IP address) - global communication\n- `ARP`: link layer (MAC address) - local communication\n\nFor this challenge, you will focus on `IP`, `ARP` & `TCP`, and therefore on IP/MAC addresses and ports.\n\nYou will need to add these 2 VMs:\n\n### For VirtualBox\n\n- [01_scan_RRF-CONTROL](https://assets.01-edu.org/sys/01_scan_RRF-CONTROL.tar.gz)\n- [01_scan_laptop](https://assets.01-edu.org/sys/01_scan_laptop.tar.gz)\n\n### For UTM\n\n- [01_scan_RRF-CONTROL](https://assets.01-edu.org/sys/01_scan_RRF-CONTROL.utm.zip)\n- [01_scan_laptop](https://assets.01-edu.org/sys/01_scan_laptop.utm.zip)\n\nTo perform your tasks you only need to use the two VMs.\n\nYou will only have control over \"01_scan_laptop\". A port forwarding is set on 10122 so you can connect through SSH, the password is a single space.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to scan the network interface (`enp0s8` for VirtualBox,  `enp0s1` for UTM) and find a way in the server \"01_scan_RRF-CONTROL\", you will know you have succeeded when you see :\n\n```\nRRF-CONTROL> █\n```\n\nBecause the virtualized Network is very slow (10 Mbps, Ethernet is usually 1000 Mbps), expect long scan times :\n\n- ARP scanning takes up to 5 minutes\n- port scanning takes up to half an one hour with the option `-T4` (even more without).\n\nMay the Fourth be with you.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n![scan2](scan2.png)\n\n> Another depiction of the `nmap` tool: in _Ocean's 8_, Rihanna uses [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) to steal a valuable diamond.\n>\n> Same strategy, different styles\n",

The purpose of the project is for you to implement some of those missing features.\n\nYou should also know that the website was created using Rails, a web application development framework written in Ruby. You can learn more about this framework in its own [website](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).\n\nYou will have to create an e-Commerce shop application with user authentication where you can sell any type of products.\nAs mentioned, some of the process is already done. So first of all, let's see what you will have to implement.\n\n### Instructions\n\nIn this website the goal is for you to fix it so that it will be possible to create users. Additionally, those users will be able to create ads to sell products in the website.\n\nTo create an ad you will have to go to the `Sell` button and create the ad. You will be able to give a title to your ad, a price, a model and a description. You also must select a brand, a color and a condition for your product. Moreover, you will be able to choose images from your folder in app/assets/images.\n\nFirst you will have to implement a controller called `registrations_controller` that can be found incomplete in app/controllers. You will need [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) which is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden.\n\n- You will have to create two definitions in this controller:\n\nThe first one is `sign_up_params` where you will have to allow the necessary params to sign up, which are:\n\n        - name\n        - email\n        - password\n        - password_confirmation\n\nThe second one is`account_update_params` where you will also need to allow the necessary params to edit or update an account, which are:\n\n        - name\n        - email\n        - password\n        - password_confirmation\n        - current_password\n\n- You will also need to complete the `products_helper.rb` located in app/helpers. This helper will be responsible for showing who is selling the products and who is able to edit and delete the ads (in this case the creator of the ad). So you will have to find a way to show the name of the seller in each product.\n\n- You have to find a way so that, only the user who creates an ad, can edit or also permanently delete it.\n\n- All e-Commerce apps need some sort of Cart. So you will have to create a shopping cart for your application.\n\nTo create the cart you will have to define a new model `Cart`.\nThe cart must work like any other e-commerce shopping cart.\n\n- You must be able to add one or more items to the cart.\n- A total must be shown, which is the sum of all the products in the cart. This total must be updated every time you add or remove an item from the cart.\n- The cart must have an `Empty Cart` button, which clears the cart and takes you back to the home page.\n- It must be possible to remove items individually from the cart as well, without emptying the whole cart.\n- The message \"Added to your cart\" and \"Removed from your cart\" must be shown when you add or remove something from the cart. These messages must disappear from the screen after a short time.\n- You must add a shopping cart icon in the home page, which shows the number of items in the cart, which updates each time you add a new product.\n\n- You will have to create a `concern` in models/concerns/ called `current_cart.rb`. A `concern` is similar to a helper which you can include in controllers throughout the app. This `concern` must allow you to add stuff to the cart when you are not signed in, and then when you sign in to an account, the cart will have the products that you added before you signed in.\n\n#### Ruby on Rails\n\nRuby is a programming language similar to Python and Perl. It is dynamically typed, interpreted, and can be modified at runtime (such as adding new methods to classes). It has many shortcuts that makes it very clean, methods are rarely over 10 lines. It has good RegEx support and works well for shell scripting.\n\nRails is a gem, or a Ruby library. Rails helps make web applications, providing classes for saving to the database, handling URLs and displaying html (along with a webserver, maintenance tasks, and much more).\n\nThis project was created using:\n\n- Ruby 3.0.0\n- Rails 6.1.3\n\nIf you decide to install other versions you will need to update your gems according to the version you are using. If you go with these versions, you already have the necessary gems in your gemfile.\n\nNow, that you know what the project is about, we will explain to you the file system architecture.\n\nWhen starting a new Rails project (with the command `rails new name_of_project`).\nThis will create a Rails application in a directory with the given name and then you will need to install the gem dependencies using the command `bundle install`.\n\nYou can learn more about the purpose of each directory that is created [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm).\n\nHere are some commands that you may need and that were used in the project:\n\n- `bundle install`\n- `bundle update`\n- `rails` -> It will give you a list of commands you can use.\n- `rails s` -> runs a server in the port 3000 by default.\n- `rails g scaffold Product brand:string model:string description:text condition:string finish:string title:string price:decimal --no-stylesheets --no-javascripts` -> Product will be our main model within the app. Scaffolding in Ruby on Rails refers to the auto-generation of a set of a model, views and a controller usually used for a single database table.\n- `rails g controller store index` -> Creates a controller named store that will have the Index path to go to if you need.\n- `rails generate uploader Image` -> This create an uploader and should give you a file in \"app/uploaders/Image_uploader.rb\"\n- `rails g migration add_image_to_products image:string` -> This will create the migration.\n- `rails db:migrate` -> Checks which missing migrations still need to be applied.\n\nYou can get the code which is already done [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/shop/shop.zip). You will notice that there is some code missing. Your task is to complete it so that the website works as explained above.\n\nYou should do this steps after unzipping:\n\n- bundle install\n- bundle update\n- rails db:migrate\n- rails db:seed\n- rails s\n\n### Bonus\n\nAs bonus for this project there are a couple things you could do:\n\n- You can add a category to the product so that the user can chose between cars, clothes, computers and many more. Or you can add more fields to describe the products, for example add more brands.\n- You can create a button `add to cart` so that it is possible to add a product to the cart without opening the ads.\n- You can find a way to remove items from the cart one by one.\n- You can implement your own display and design.\n- You can add a payment method.\n",

Let's code!\n\nThe first step to achieve in your quest is to conceive your being ; for that, 2 things have to be done:\n\n- set some parameters (`<head>` tag)\n- define the structure, or skeleton (`<body>` tag)\n\n#### Parameters\n\nTo create any project, some things need to be declared in the HTML file - those are not visible elements in your page, but things cannot work without them.\nSet your page with [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) tags, and also put a [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) to name the entity you're going to create.\n\n#### Structure\n\nNow you have to define the skeleton of your future creation.\nRemember this as a general rule for any further project you will start: a good way of setting up a project is to think about all the elements needed, organize and divide them in blocks.\n\nLet's define the first level of elements that your entity will be made of ; we're going to split it into 3 main chunks: the face, the upper body, and the lower body.\n\nInside the `<body>` tag of your HTML file, create 3 divisions using `<section>` tags, putting the following text content inside for each: `face`, `upper-body`, `lower-body`.\n\nIf you open you HTML file in the browser, you should see those 3 texts appear on the screen.\n\n### Code examples\n\nCreate a `div` tag with `hello` as text content inside the `body`:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div>hello</div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### How to submit\n\nThis exercise must be submited as a JS file, thankfully, javascript allows you to write `HTML` !\n\nHere is how you would submit the `HTML` sample from above in the editor:\n\n```js\ndocument.documentElement.innerHTML = `\n<body>\n  <div>hello</div>\n</body>\n`\n```\n\n> You do only need to write what's inside the `<html>` tag excluding the `<html>` tag itself\n\n### Notions\n\n- [`html` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)\n- [`head` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)\n- [`title` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)\n- [`body` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)\n- [`section` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)\n",

Well, you will have to create another traffic control strategy and its simulation. However, it will have to be done without traffic lights and with a smart intersection management strategy this time.\n\nOverused intersections might lead to severe traffic jams on multiple roads, which wastes drivers' time and money and causes unnecessary air pollution. Additionally, according to a study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the U.S., it is reported that about 96% of the intersection-related crashes had critical reasons to be the driver's fault, such as inadequate surveillance, false assumption of other actions, and turns with an obstructed view.\n\n[Autonomous vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car) (AVs) are a promising solution to traffic accidents. An optimistic prediction is that AVs will be publicly available in the next decade, and thus traffic issues related to autonomous vehicles are also being extensively investigated.\n\nCurrent intersection management strategies, such as the traditional traffic lights and other more advanced methods, are designed exclusively for human drivers. With the rapid development of AVs, new traffic strategies must be taken into account.\nThis is where you come in. You will have to create this new traffic strategy algorithm so that AVs can pass an intersection without any collisions and with a minimum of traffic congestion.\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### **Intersection**\n\nThere are various shapes of intersections, we will focus on the widely seen cross intersection, where each lane has a different route:\n\n- `r`, turning right\n- `s`, straight ahead\n- `l`, turning left\n\n```console\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |r  | s | l |   |   |   |\n_______________| ← | ↓ | → |   |   |   |________________\n                           |            ↑ r\n_______________            |            ________________\n                           |            ← s\n_______________            |            ________________\n                           |            ↓ l\n___________________________|____________________________\n           l ↑             |\n_______________            |            ________________\n           s →             |\n_______________            |            ________________\n           r ↓             |\n_______________            |            ________________\n               |   |   |   | ← | ↑ | → |\n               |   |   |   | l | s | r |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n               |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n```\n\nThe simplicity of this intersection is that each lane has only one outgoing direction, that is, the route of the vehicle in the\nintersection area can only be represented by the corresponding lane.\n\n---\n\n#### **Vehicles**\n\n```console\n  ______\n /|_||_\\`.__\n=`-(_)--(_)-'\n```\n\nAs stated above you will be considering that all vehicles are autonomous (AVs), also known as self-driving cars.\nYou will have to implement the physics for this type of vehicles by taking into account the following rules :\n\n1. AVs driving on a lane with a **given route** must follow the direction of that route; the AVs can't change lanes or routes.\n\n2. AVs must have at least 3 different velocities. Therefore the **smart intersection system** can control the velocity of the vehicle.\\\n   This will be the way of controlling the current velocity/time/distance (depending on the algorithm you implement) of the AVs.\n\n3. Each AV must respect a safety distance from other AVs.\\\n   If a vehicle is driving at a high velocity and encounters another vehicle, it must detect that vehicle and keep a safe distance from it. It should not collide!\n   You are free to decide the safety distance, but it must be a strictly positive value.\n\n4. Other vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, are not considered in this project.\n\n5. You must implement physics for the vehicle, such as `velocity = distance / time`. Each vehicle must have a :\n\n- `time`: the time that the AV takes to leave the intersection\n- `distance`: the distance that the AV takes to leave the intersection\n- `velocity`: the speed of the AV at the current time\n\n---\n\n#### **Animation**\n\nAnimation is required for this project. You will have to find some assets for the vehicles and roads. Here are some assets for this:\n\n- [limezu](https://limezu.itch.io/)\n- [finalbossblue](http://finalbossblues.com/timefantasy/free-graphics/).\n- [mobilegamegraphics](https://mobilegamegraphics.com/product-category/all_products/freestuff/).\n- [spriters-resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).\n\nAnimation is not just rendering an image into the canvas. By using assets, you get to decide your \"world coordinate system\" for the rendered image and therefore you create your own animation. But this is not enough. Basically, you must animate while moving.\n\nA simple example of movement animation is imagining a vehicle with a route of `r`. This means that the vehicle arrives at the\nintersection and turns right. If we render just an image of the vehicle facing down and it arrives to the point of turning, the rendered image\nwill continue to be facing down and not right, like it should.\n\nConcluding, you must animate the vehicle while moving, manipulating the image so that it appears that the vehicle is turning.\n\n---\n\n#### **Commands**\n\nYou will have to implement several commands so that the simulation can be well tested. The commands to be implemented are the following :\n\n1. The creation of vehicles must be done using the keyboard events. It must be able to randomly generate vehicles with different routes. The keys to be used are the following :\n\n- `Arrow Up`, generate vehicles from south to north.\n- `Arrow Down`, generate vehicles from north to south.\n- `Arrow Right`, generate vehicles from west to east.\n- `Arrow Left`, generate vehicles from east to west.\n\n2. It must also be possible to use the key `R` to continually generate random vehicles (using the game loop).\n\n3. The `Esc` key must finish the simulation and generate a window with all statistics (you can see more about the statistics in the below section).\n\n4. When spamming the same key, the vehicles should not be generated all at the same time. In other words, the vehicles should not be created on top of each other.\n\n---\n\n#### **Statistics**\n\nYour program must be able to generate statistics, as stated above. These must be displayed in a window, right after the user tries to exit the simulation.\n\nThe statistics must include:\n\n- Max number of vehicles that passed the intersection\n- Max velocity of all vehicles (Display the fastest speed achieved)\n- Min velocity of all vehicles (Display the slowest speed reached)\n- Max time that the vehicles took to pass the intersection (for all vehicles, display the one that took more time)\n- Min time that the vehicles took to pass the intersection (for all vehicles, display the one that took less time)\n  - The time starts to count whenever the vehicle is detected by the **smart intersection algorithm** until the end of the intersection, which is when the vehicle is removed from the canvas.\n- Close calls, this is when both vehicles pass each other with a violation of the safe distance.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nYou can see an example [here](https://youtu.be/_z8WDX_YS9k).\n\n---\n\n### Bonus\n\nYou can implement the following optional features:\n\n- Create your own assets for the animation of the vehicles\n- Add more statistics\n- Consider acceleration and deceleration on the physics of your game. That means that the cars don't change automatically of speed (e.g. different cars can take different times to change from 50 to 10 depending on how good the brakes are)\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- Rust programming language\n- [sdl2](https://docs.rs/sdl2/0.34.3/sdl2/)\n- Animation\n- Algorithm\n- Mathematics\n- Events\n",

It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menus. It focuses on making requests to the backend in order to get specific chunks of data to be used or send data to be stored on the backend.\n\nHTML, CSS, and Javascript are the languages used for frontend development. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the frontend. Frontend frameworks may be used to simplify a developer's work.\n\n#### Framework\n\nYou will have to use a JS framework. It is up to you to choose which one you are going to use.\n\nFrameworks will help you to organize and implement the features you want on your project, so that you can get more work done in an easier and faster way.\n\nSome of the most known JS frameworks around are:\n\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n- [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)\n\nCaution: Note that JS frameworks are different from JS libraries. JS libraries contain code snippets that are used to perform common JavaScript functions, while frameworks will help you by laying out the groundwork/building the bases for your JS project.\n\n---\n\n### Backend\n\nThe backend is all of the technology required to process the incoming requests and generate and send responses to the client.\nThis is typically divided into three major parts:\n\n- **Server**: this is the computer that receives requests. It acts as the entry point for all incoming requests. While there are specialized machines designed for this purpose, you can use your own computer as a server.\n\n- **App**: is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database and sends responses. This is where the core logic of your social network resides. It contains the logic for handling various requests based on HTTP or other protocols. Some of these functions are known as middleware, which execute between receiving a request and sending a response.\n\n- **Database**: As you may already know, the database is used to organize and store data. Many requests sent to the server involve database queries. Clients may request information stored in the database or submit data to be added to it.\n\n#### App\n\nThe backend may consist, like said above, of an **app** containing all the backend logic. This logic will therefore have several middleware, for example:\n\n- Authentication, since HTTP is a stateless protocol, we can use several ways to overcome and authenticate a client/user. You must use [sessions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-management-waf-protections) and [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).\n- Images handling, supporting various types of extensions. In this project you have to handle at least JPEG, PNG and GIF types. You will have to store the images, it can be done by storing the file/path in the database and saving the image in a specific file system.\n- Websocket, handling the connections in real time, between clients. This will help with the private chats.\n\nFor the web server you can take a look at [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/), it can serve your site, services and apps and its written in **Go**. Or you are free to create your own web server.\n\n#### Sqlite\n\nIn order to store the data in your social network, you will use the database library SQLite.\nTo structure your database and to achieve better performance we highly advise you to take a look at the [entity relationship diagram](https://www.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/) and build one based on your own database.\n\nTo know more about SQLite you can check the [SQLite page](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).\n\n#### Migrate\n\nYou will have to create migrations for this project so every time the application runs, it creates the specific tables to make the project work properly.\n\nFor this, you must focus on a folder structure similar to this one:\n\n```console\nstudent$ tree .\nbackend\n├── pkg\n│   ├── db\n│   │   ├── migrations\n│   │   │   └── sqlite\n│   │   │       ├── 000001_create_users_table.down.sql\n│   │   │       ├── 000001_create_users_table.up.sql\n│   │   │       ├── 000002_create_posts_table.down.sql\n│   │   │       └── 000002_create_posts_table.up.sql\n│   │   └── sqlite\n│   |       └── sqlite.go\n|   |\n|   └── ...other_pkgs.go\n|\n└── server.go\n```\n\nThe folder structure is organized in a way that helps you to **understand** and **use** migrations, where you can apply it using a simple path, for example: `file://backend/pkg/db/migrations/sqlite`. It can be organized as you wish but **do not forget that the application of migrations and the file organization will be tested**.\n\nFor migrations you can use [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) package or other package that better suits your project.\n\nAll migrations should be stored on a specific folder, as above. The `sqlite.go` should present the connection to the database, the applying of the migrations and other useful functionalities that you may need to implement.\n\nThis migration system can help you manage your time and testing, by filling your database.\n\n---\n\n### docker\n\n**Containerizing the Backend and Frontend**\n\nYour project should consist of two Docker images, one for the backend and another for the frontend. Each of these containers serves a specific purpose and communicates with each other to provide a functional social network application.\n\n**Backend Container:**\n\nCreate a Docker image for the backend of your social network application. This container will run the server-side logic of your application, handle requests from clients, and interact with the database.\n\n**Frontend Container:**\n\nCreate a Docker image for the frontend of your social network application. This container will serve the client-side code, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, to users browsers. It will also communicate with the backend via `HTTP requests`.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Name your frontend Docker image appropriately.\n- Make sure that the backend container exposes the necessary ports for communication with the frontend and external clients and the frontend container exposes the appropriate port to serve the frontend content to users' browsers.\n\n---\n\n### Authentication\n\nIn order for the users to use the social network they will have to make an account. So you will have to make a registration and login form. To register, every user should provide at least:\n\n- Email\n- Password\n- First Name\n- Last Name\n- Date of Birth\n- Avatar/Image (Optional)\n- Nickname (Optional)\n- About Me (Optional)\n\nNote that the **Avatar/Image**, **Nickname** and **About Me** should be present in the form but the user can skip the filling of those fields.\n\nWhen the user logins, he/she should stay logged in until he/she chooses a logout option that should be available at all times. For this you will have to implement [sessions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-management-waf-protections) and [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).\n\nYou can implement your own package for sessions and cookies or you can take a look at some packages to help you.\n\n---\n\n### Followers\n\nWhen navigating the social network the user should be able to follow and unfollow other users. Needless to say that to unfollow a user you have to be following him/her.\n\nRegarding following someone, the user must initiate this by sending a follow request to the desired user. The recipient user can then choose to \"accept\" or \"decline\" the request. However, if the recipient user has a public profile (as explained in the next section), this request-and-accept process is bypassed and the user who sent the request automatically starts following the user with the pubic profile.\n\n---\n\n### Profile\n\nEvery profile should contain :\n\n- User information (every information requested in the register form apart from the **Password**, obviously)\n- User activity\n  - Every post made by the user\n- Followers and following users (display the users that are following the owner of the profile and who he/she is following)\n\nThere are two types of profiles: a public profile and a private profile. A public profile will display the information specified above to every user on the social network, while the private profile will only display that same information to their followers only.\n\nWhen the user is in their own profile it should be available an option that allows the user to turn its profile public or private.\n\n---\n\n### Posts\n\nAfter a user is logged in he/she can create posts and comments on already created posts. While creating a post or a comment, the user can include an image or GIF.\n\nThe user must be able to specify the privacy of the post:\n\n- public (all users in the social network will be able to see the post)\n- almost private (only followers of the creator of the post will be able to see the post)\n- private (only the followers chosen by the creator of the post will be able to see it)\n\n---\n\n### Groups\n\nA user must be able to create a group. The group should have a title and a description given by the creator and he/she can invite other users to join the group.\n\nThe invited users need to accept the invitation to be part of the group. They can also invite other people once they are already part of the group. Another way to enter the group is to request to be in it and only the creator of the group would be allowed to accept or refuse the request.\n\nTo make a request to enter a group the user must find it first. This will be possible by having a section where you can browse through all groups.\n\nWhen in a group, a user can create posts and comment the posts already created. These posts and comments will only be displayed to members of the group.\n\nA user belonging to the group can also create an event, making it available for the other group users. An event should have:\n\n- Title\n- Description\n- Day/Time\n- 2 Options (at least):\n  - Going\n  - Not going\n\nAfter creating the event every user can choose one of the options for the event.\n\n---\n\n### Chat\n\nUsers should be able to send private messages to other users that they are following or being followed, in other words, at least one of the users must be following the other.\n\nWhen a user sends a message, the recipient will instantly receive it through Websockets if they are following the sender or if the recipient has a public profile.\n\nIt should be able for the users to send emojis to each other.\n\nGroups should have a common chat room, so if a user is a member of the group he/she should be able to send and receive messages to this group chat.\n\n---\n\n### Notifications\n\nA user must be able to see the notifications in every page of the project. New notifications are different from new private messages and should be displayed in a different way!\n\nA user should be notified if he/she:\n\n- has a private profile and some other user sends him/her a following request\n- receives a group invitation, so he can refuse or accept the request\n- is the creator of a group and another user requests to join the group, so he can refuse or accept the request\n- is member of a group and an event is created\n\nEvery other notification created by you that isn't on the list is welcomed too.\n\n---\n\n### Allowed Packages\n\n- The [standard Go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed\n- [Gorilla websocket](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket)\n- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/)\n- [sql-migration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)\n- [migration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Boostport/migration)\n- [sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)\n- [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt)\n- [gofrs/uuid](https://github.com/gofrs/uuid) or [google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid)\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- Authentication :\n  - Sessions and cookies\n- Using and [setting up Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n  - Containerizing an application\n  - Compatibility/Dependency\n  - Creating images\n- SQL language\n  - Manipulation of databases\n  - Migrations\n- The basics of encryption\n- Websocket\n",

      "full_content": "## Sortable\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou are a villain and your dream is to get rid of those annoying, yoga-pant-wearing, weird masked **superheroes**.\nYou never understood why some of them are considered to be superheroes, just because they are rich. Others annoy you with their philosophical speeches.\n\nWe've found _confidential_ information about those superheroes.\n\n**Your task** is to build a web page to organize all the data about those smartypants. All that data can be found [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/akabab/superhero-api/0.2.0/api/all.json) in `all.json`.\n\nYou must write all of the code from scratch. You are not allowed to rely on any frameworks or libraries like React, Vue, Svelte etc.\n\n#### Fetching the data\n\nIn order to get the information, you should use `fetch`.\nWhen you use `fetch` in JS, it always returns a `Promise`. We will look more deeply into that later on. For now, take a look at this:\n\n```js\n// This function is called only after the data has been fetched, and parsed.\nconst loadData = (heroes) => {\n  console.log(heroes);\n};\n\n// Request the file with fetch, and the data will be downloaded to your browser cache.\nfetch(\"https://rawcdn.githack.com/akabab/superhero-api/0.2.0/api/all.json\")\n  .then((response) => response.json()) // parse the response from JSON\n  .then(loadData); // .then will call the `loadData` function with the JSON value.\n```\n\n#### Display\n\nNot all the information is valuable at a glance, so we will only show some of the fields in a `<table>` element. The necessary data will be:\n\n- Icon (`.images.xs`, should be displayed as images and not as a string)\n- Name (`.name`)\n- Full Name (`.biography.fullName`)\n- Powerstats (each entry of `.powerstats`)\n- Race (`.appearance.race`)\n- Gender (`.appearance.gender`)\n- Height (`.appearance.height`)\n- Weight (`.appearance.weight`)\n- Place Of Birth (`.biography.placeOfBirth`)\n- Alignment (`.biography.alignment`)\n\nThe information must be displayed in multiple pages. Use a `<select>` input to chose the page size from `10`, `20`,`50`, `100` or `all results`.\n\nThe default page size selected option must be `20`.\n\n#### Search\n\nIt must be possible to filter information by searching the name as a string. For example, searching _\"man\"_ should find all superheros with `\"man\"` in their name.\n\nThe search should be interactive. In other words, the results should be filtered after every keystroke. So we don't need a \"search\" button.\n\n#### Sort\n\nIt will be valuable to sort the information in the table by any of its columns. Results should be sortable alphabetically or numerically.\n\n- Initially all rows should be sorted by the column `name` by `ascending` order.\n- The first click on a column heading will sort the table by the data in that column in `ascending` order.\n- Consecutive clicks on a column heading will toggle between `ascending` and `descending`.\n- Some of the columns are composed of strings, but represent numerical values. For example, when the `weight` column is sorted in ascending order, then `\"78 kg\"` must be displayed before `\"100 kg\"`.\n- Missing values should **always** be sorted last, irrespective of `ascending` or `descending`.\n\n> When dealing with heroes, **speed** is critical. All operations must be performed quickly, without slowing the browser down.\n\n### Bonus\n\nAdditional features will be critical to your success. Here's a few which will give you a bigger boost:\n\n- Specify the field that the search applies to.\n- Custom search operators\n  - `include`\n  - `exclude`\n  - `fuzzy`\n  - `equal`, `not equal`, `greater than` and `lesser than` for numbers (including weight and height).\n- Detail view. Clicking a hero from the list will show all the details and large image.\n- A slick design. Spend some time improving the look and feel by playing around with CSS. Have fun with it.\n- Modify the URL with the search term, so that if you copy and paste the URL in a different tab, it will display the same column filters. If you have implemented detail view, the state of which hero is displayed should also form part of the URL.\n",

Each of the tasks can have their dependencies and restrictions, lets say you are putting together a new cabinet and you have 7 boards.\n\n| Task          |                Needed                 |    Result     | Cycle |\n| ------------- | :-----------------------------------: | :-----------: | :---: |\n| do_doorknobs  |               board: 1                | doorknobs: 1  |  15   |\n| do_background |               board: 2                | background: 1 |  20   |\n| do_shelf      |               board: 1                |   shelf: 1    |  10   |\n| do_cabinet    | doorknobs: 2; background: 1; shelf: 3 |  cabinet: 1   |  30   |\n\nThe purpose of this example is to optimize time and cabinet, basically the cabinet is the last product to achieve in the project and time is to be prioritized so that the building of your cabinet is done the fastest way possible.\n\nThe tasks should be done in this order to achieve a maximum optimization regarding time and cabinet:\n\n```console\n0:do_shelf\n0:do_shelf\n0:do_shelf\n0:do_doorknobs\n0:do_doorknobs\n0:do_background\n20:do_cabinet\nNo more process doable at cycle 51\n```\n\nSo the number before the task represents the cycle when the task starts. The tasks can run separately or at the same time depending on the stocks that are used.\n\nIn the example above we have the first 6 tasks beginning at cycle 0 and running at the same time, this happens because we have 7 boards and all of them can be used in the first 6 tasks without any dependencies. After the 6 tasks are finished it has already passed 20 cycles, so the next task (do_cabinet) will start at cycle 20 and end at cycle 50. This task did not start earlier because it is dependant of the results of the others.\n\nWell, optimizing a regular schedule may help you to prioritize your tasks and make your program work with that purpose.\n\nPriority based project scheduling is a quick and easy heuristic scheduling technique that makes use of two components to construct a resource feasible project schedule, a [priority rule and a schedule generation scheme](http://www.pmknowledgecenter.com/node/256).\n\nHere are some ways to schedule a scheme:\n\n- [Serial schedule generation scheme](http://www.pmknowledgecenter.com/dynamic_scheduling/baseline/optimizing-regular-scheduling-objectives-schedule-generation-schemes): selects the activities one by one from the list and schedules them as-soon-as-possible in the schedule.\n\n- [Parallel schedule generation scheme](http://www.pmknowledgecenter.com/dynamic_scheduling/baseline/optimizing-regular-scheduling-objectives-schedule-generation-schemes): selects at each predefined time period the activities available to be scheduled and schedules them in the list as long as enough resources are available.\n\n#### File format\n\nFirst we need a configuration file that contains the processes and must obey the following instructions:\n\n- A `#` that defines comments\n- A description of the stocks available at the start, with the following format\n\n  `<stock_name>:<quantity>`\n\n- A description of the processes:\n\n  `<name>:(<need>:<quantity>;<need>:<quantity>;...):(<result>:<quantity>;<result>:<quantity>;...):<nb_cycle>`\n\n- A single line to indicate the elements to optimize, possibly containing the `time` keyword :\n\n  `optimize:(<stock_name>|time)`\n\nSo, as we said above, you must create at least two configuration file of your own. One file that ends when the resources are consumed, and the other which can rotate indefinitely.(will be explained in the next topic)\n\n### Stock exchange program\n\nThen we can run the **The stock exchange program** to generate a schedule.\n\n- It takes 2 parameters:\n\n  `./stock_exchange <file> <waiting_time>`\n\n- The first is the `configuration file` with all stocks and processes. The second parameter is a waiting time that the program should not exceed in seconds.\n\n- In the situation where the resources will be consumed and the processes will stop, due to the lack of resources, the display will go all the way without errors.\n\n- In the situation where the system self-powers and rotates indefinitely, you will choose a reasonable shutdown condition, and your stocks should show that the whole process went well several times.\n\n- There is no obligation of invariance between two executions. This means that, for the same configuration, the first recommended solution, may be different from the second one.\n\n- It is up to you to create and organize the display, it must nevertheless allow the understanding of the main actions carried out by the program.\n\n```console\nMain Processes:\n 0:do_shelf\n 0:do_shelf\n 0:do_shelf\n 0:do_doorknobs\n 0:do_doorknobs\n 0:do_background\n 20:do_cabinet\nNo more process doable at cycle 51\nStock:\n board => 0\n doorknobs => 0\n background => 0\n shelf => 0\n cabinet => 1\n```\n\n- The display must also produce an output usable by the checker program, in the following format:\n\n  `<cycle>:<process_name>`\n\nThe generated schedule is then saved as a log with the same name.\n\nSo if you run:\n\n```console\ngo run . examples/simple 10\n```\n\nYou get this generated schedule:\n\n```console\n$ cat examples/simple.log\n0:buy_materiel\n10:build_product\n40:delivery\nNo more process doable at cycle 61\n$\n```\n\n---\n\n### Checker\n\nWe can then verify if the schedule is doable with the **checker** program:\n\n- It takes 2 parameters:\n\n  `.\\checker <file> <log_file>`\n\n  - The first parameter is the configuration file, the second is a log file containing the trace of stock exchange program which must be checked.\n\n- The display must indicate whether the sequence is correct, or indicate the cycle and the process which are causing the problem. In all cases, at the end of the program, stocks are displayed, as well as the last cycle.\n\n#### Example\n\n- Configuration file:\n\n```\n#\n# simple example\n#\n# stock\nname:quantity\neuro:10\n#\n# process name:(need1:quantity1;need2:quantity2;...):(result1:quantity1;result2:quantity2;...):delay\n#\nbuy_materiel:(euro:8):(material:1):10\nbuild_product:(material:1):(product:1):30\ndelivery:(product:1):(client_content:1):20\n#\n# optimize time for no process possible (eating stock, produce all possible),\n# or maximize some products over a long delay\n# optimize:(time|stock1;time|stock2;...)\n#\noptimize:(time;client_content)\n#\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nRunning the stock exchange program:\n\n```console\n$ go run . examples/simple 10\nMain Processes:\n 0:buy_materiel\n 10:build_product\n 40:delivery\nNo more process doable at cycle 61\nStock:\n euro => 2\n materiel => 0\n product => 0\n client_content => 1\n$\n```\n\nRunning the checker program:\n\n```console\n$ go run ./checker examples/simple examples/simple.log\nEvaluating: 0:buy_materiel\nEvaluating: 10:build_product\nEvaluating: 40:delivery\nTrace completed, no error detected.\n$\n```\n\n---\n\nRunning the stock exchange program with error, you can see the correct file [here](examples/simple/simple)\n\n```console\n$ cat examples/simple\neuro:10\n:(euro:8):(material:1):10\nbuild_product:(material:1):(product:1):30\ndelivery:(product:1):(client_content:1):20\noptimize:(time;client_content)\n$ go run . examples/simple 10\nError while parsing `:(euro:8):(material:1):10`\n$\n```\n\nRunning the checker program with error, you can see the correct file [here](examples/simple/simple.log)\n\n```console\n$ cat examples/simple.log\n0:buy_materiel\n10:build_product\n10:build_product\n40:delivery\n# No more process doable at cycle 61\n$ go run ./checker examples/simple examples/simple.log\nEvaluating: 0:buy_materiel\nEvaluating: 10:build_product\nEvaluating: 10:build_product\nEvaluating: 40:delivery\nError detected\nat 10:build_product stock insufficient\n$\n```\n",

Creating\na project from scratch will not be asked, instead you will have **to add features or fix the code of a given application**.\n\nThe application you are about to work on is a [**Desktop System Monitor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_monitor). The app will monitor the computer system resources and performance, such as CPU, RAM, SWAP, Fan, Network and more.\nFor the GUI you will use the [_Dear ImGui_](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm) library for C++.\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### **Dear ImGui**\n\nAs stated above the GUI you are going to use is _Dear ImGui_ there are some notions you should know about this library/API.\n\nThe first important point to be aware of is that ImGui is an **immediate mode graphic user interface**, as the name implies it: \"ImGui\".\nThere are two types of UIs, **retained mode** and **immediate mode**.\n\n- **Immediate mode**: the application state is separated from the graphics library. It is the application responsibility for drawing commands when necessary. In other words, in immediate mode the client calls directly results in the rendering of graphics objects to the display.\n\n- **Retained mode**: the client calls do not directly cause actual rendering, but instead update an abstract internal model, which is maintained within the library's data space. You can see more about this mode [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode).\n\nFor this API there is no need for specific builds, you can add the files to your existing project.\nTo integrate `Dear ImGui` you must use a backend, this backend passes mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs and a variety of settings. It is\nin charge of rendering the resulting vertices.\n\nThe backend will be provided by us, in a file system described in the next paragraph.\nYou will have to install `sdl` by running the command `apt install libsdl2-dev`.\n\n---\n\n#### **File System**\n\nThe file system provided, [here](https://assets.01-edu.org/system-monitor/system-monitor.zip), will contain all the `ImGui IPA`. For easier understanding, see below a representation of the fs.\n\n```console\n$ tree system-monitor\n├── header.h\n├── imgui                                 // <-- ImGui APIs\n│   └── lib\n│       ├── backend                       // <-- ImGui backend\n│       │   ├── imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp\n│       │   ├── imgui_impl_opengl3.h\n│       │   ├── imgui_impl_sdl.cpp\n│       │   └── imgui_impl_sdl.h\n│       ├── gl3w\n│       │   └── GL\n│       │       ├── gl3w.c\n│       │       ├── gl3w.h\n│       │       └── glcorearb.h\n│       ├── imconfig.h\n│       ├── imgui.cpp\n│       ├── imgui_demo.cpp\n│       ├── imgui_draw.cpp\n│       ├── imgui.h\n│       ├── imgui_internal.h\n│       ├── imgui_tables.cpp\n│       ├── imgui_widgets.cpp\n│       ├── imstb_rectpack.h\n│       ├── imstb_textedit.h\n│       └── imstb_truetype.h\n├── main.cpp                             // <-- main file, where the application will\n├── Makefile                             //     render (main loop)\n├── mem.cpp                              // <-- memory resources and processes information\n├── network.cpp                          // <-- network resources\n└── system.cpp                           // <-- all system resources\n\n5 directories, 28 files\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Linux and Proc**\n\nTo monitor the computer system resources and performance you will have to use the `/proc` filesystem.\n\nThe `/proc` filesystem is a virtual system that does not exist on disk. This system is created by the kernel when the system boots, and destroyed by it when the system shuts down.\n\nThis filesystem contains information about the system, from the CPU, to memory, to active processes and much more. For this reason, it can be regarded as\na control and information center for the kernel. As a matter of fact, a lot of the system utilities are simple calls to files in this directory.\n\nYou can acquire more knowledge about this filesystem by taking a look to the `proc` manual page (`man proc`).\n\n---\n\n#### **Monitorization**\n\nFor this project you must present the following monitorization:\n\n- **System monitor**, that will contain :\n\n  - The type of OS (Operating System).\n  - The user logged into the computer.\n  - The computer name, this being the **hostname**.\n  - The total number of tasks/processes that are currently running, sleeping, uninterruptible, zombie, traced/stopped or interrupted.\n  - Type of CPU\n  - A tabbed section containing `CPU`, `Fan` and `Thermal` information, this information include a performance graphic for all those topics.\n    This graph should contain some kind of checkbox or button to be able to stop the animation whenever the user desires to do so.\n    Additionally, it should also have two slider bars.\n    The first slider bar should be able to control the `FPS` of the graph, and the second slider bar should control the `y` scale of the graph.\n\n    - `CPU` should present this graph with an overlay text saying the current percentage of the CPU.\n\n    - `Fan`, should include the following information, the status of the fan, (enable/active), the current speed and the level. And should also present the graph stated above.\n\n    - `Thermal`, should present the graph stated above with an overlay text saying the current temperature of the computer (usually the cpu sensor).\n\n    example :\n\n    ![image](system.gif)\n\n- **Memory and process monitor**, that will contain :\n\n  - The Physic Memory (RAM) being used, it must have some kind of visual display of this usage.\n  - The Virtual Memory (SWAP) being used, it should also include a visual display.\n  - The Disk usage, same here.\n  - A tab bar that should contain a table of processes with the following columns :\n    - **PID**, with the process identification.\n    - **Name**, name of the process.\n    - **State**, current state of the process.\n    - **CPU usage**, how much CPU the process is using in percentage.\n    - **Memory usage**, how much memory the process is using in percentage.\n  - A text box that lets the user filter the table. \n    - Users must be able to select multiple rows of the table.\n\n    example :\n\n    ![image](mem.gif)\n\n- **Network**, that will contain :\n\n  - The network ipv4, (`lo`, `wlp5s0` and other networks that the computer may have).\n  - A tab bar that should contain two tables :\n    - `RX` (network receiver) containing the following data : bytes, packets, errs, drop, fifo, frame, compressed and multicast.\n    - `TX` (network transmitter) containing the following data : bytes, packets, errs, drop, fifo, colls, carrier and compressed.\n  - It should also contain a tabbed section for both `RX` and `TX`, those sections should display a visual usage (ex: a progress bar), of all network present on the computer. This visual display should obey the following rules:\n\n    - Each network should be converted from **bytes** to **GB**, **KB** or **MB** depending on the value. It should not display values that\n      are too big or too small. In other words it should be adjustable.\n\n      example :\n\n      **452755738 bytes** => **431.78 MB**. // perfect\\\n      **452755738 bytes** => **0.42 GB**. // too small\\\n      **452755738 bytes** => **442144.28.6 KB**. // too big\n\n  - The visual display should go from 0GB to 2GB\n\n  example :\n\n  ![image](network.gif)\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- C++ programming language\n- UI/UX\n  - Dear ImGui\n- CPU\n- Memory\n  - SWAP\n  - RAM\n  - Disk\n- Network\n- Linux filesystem\n  - proc\n  - sysfs\n",

You will be provided with a game engine, and your objective will be to create an AI player which will battle against other AI players to win the game.\n\n### Useful files\n- [index.html (Game Engine)](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/game_students/index.html)\n- [hard.js](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/ai/hard.js)\n- [license-to-kill.js](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/ai/license-to-kill.js)\n- [random.js](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/ai/random.js)\n- [right.js](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/ai/right.js)\n- [snail.js](https://((DOMAIN))/git/root/public/raw/branch/master/subjects/tron/ai/snail.js)\n\n### Rules\nThe objective is for the AI player to stay alive as long as possible. The game ends when no player can move, or both players are dead.\n\nThe player with the highest score wins.\n\n- AI players cannot stay still during a turn, they must make a move.\n- Every time the AI player moves, it leaves a colorful trail.\n- The AI player can only move to a blank tile, and cannot move outside of the 100 x 100 map.\n- AI players can move `left`, `right` or `forward`. Moving backwards kills the AI player, because of the colorful trail.\n- If too much CPU power is required to decide where to move, the AI player dies.\n- If two AI players move to the same spot, both of them die.\n\n### Controls\nYou can use the arrows or scroll to move step by step through the game. `shift` will make it fast. You can also click anywhere on the progress bar to seek through the history.\n\n### How to write your AI\n- Create `ai.js` at the root of your repository.\n- Copy the contents of `random.js`, and paste it to `ai.js`.\n- Edit the `update` function which is called each turn.\n\n> Do not rename the `update` function. It is the function that the worker will try to run to test your AI player.\n\n### Preparing to test your AI player\nLet's say that you want to battle `ai.js` against `random.js`. You will need to run the game engine, and specify the local path or web path to both of those files.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll use a single directory to demonstrate. So place `index.html` and `random.js` in the same directory as `ai.js`.\n\nYou'll need to create a simple web server. From the command line, `cd` into that directory, and execute the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ python3 -m http.server\nServing HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/)\n```\n\nNow open your browser at the specified port. For us, that will be where the `http.server` is running:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000\n```\n\nYou can modify the path to load the players using a relative path:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/?ai=random.js+ai.js\n```\n\nEach game has a `seed` which will spawn the players in different positions. When you modify the path, it will add a `seed` to the query path. You can change the `seed` to spawn the players elsewhere, or remove it for a random one to be generated.\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/?ai=random.js+ai.js&seed=207734936\n```\n\nYou can also specify a web path to some `.js` file like so:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8000/?ai=https://example.com/example.js+ai.js\n```\n\nOpen the inspector of the browser and **disable the cache**.\n\n### Getting started with improving your AI player\nLet's change the `update` function so that your AI only goes forward.\n\nReplace this line just before the `return` of the update function:\n\n```js\nconst available = coordsInBound.filter(isFree);\n\n// And I return a random available coord\nreturn pickRandom(available);\n```\n\n...with this line:\n\n```js\n// always return the first free coordinates\nreturn coordsInBound.filter(isFree)[0];\n```\n\nSave the file, and re-run the game. If the cache was correctly disabled, you will have changed the behavior of your AI player from random movements, to only making forward moves.\n\nTo better understand controlling your AI player, read the comments inside `ai.js`, and do a lot of testing.\n\nDuring the audit, you will be competing against other AI players. Be aware, that there is a possibility for the auditor to use their own AI.\n\n_May the best tron win :)_\n\nHave fun and good luck.\n",

Example with\n`arg3` and `arg4`:\n\n```js\nlet myFirstFunction = (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) => {\n  //<as many arguments as needed\n  console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)\n} //<-end of the scope of the function\n// Now we call the function\nmyFirstFunction('first arg', 'second arg', 3, 4)\n// \"first arg\"\n// \"second arg\"\n// 3\n// 4\n```\n\nFinally, please note that you can name your arguments however you please. Just\nmake sure that you reuse the proper name inside the scope of your function.\nExample:\n\n```js\nlet myFirstFunction = (continent, country, city, temperature) => {\n  //<as many arguments as needed\n  console.log(continent, country, city, temperature)\n} //<-end of the scope of the function\n// Now we call the function\nmyFirstFunction('Europe', 'France', 'Paris', '30°C')\n// \"Europe\"\n// \"France\"\n// \"Paris\"\n// \"30°C\"\n```\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou want to conquer the world! _(of entertainment)_.\n\nIn this exercise you will have to declare the function `duos`.\n\nThis function will take two arguments and will log them together with an `and`\nand an `!`\n\n> Example: calling: `duos('Batman', 'Robin')` should log : `Batman and Robin !`\n\nYou will then declare the function `duosWork`. This function will take three\narguments and will log them togethers as in the example below.\n\n> Example: calling: `duosWork('Batman', 'Robin', 'protect Gotham')` should log :\n> `Batman and Robin protect Gotham !`\n",

Your friend who started helping on the last exercise, raised a question that you didn't think about before. What would happen if people showed up with a plus-one? Or a plus-three?\n\nOh no! You didn't take into account people uninvited who might come with your guests.\n\nFor now, what your friend suggested is to call the guests and try to find out who would come with company.\n\nCreate an `uninvited.mjs` program that will open a server to remotely not just access, but also update the list. It will need to handle http `POST` requests to add new guests.\n\nHere below are your program/server's expected behaviors:\n\n- It has to listen on port `5000` and it will have to print a simple message on the console, specifying the listening port.\n- Its HTTP response should contain a coherent status code depending on the handling of the received HTTP request. More specifically, your server should be able to respond with the following status codes: `201` and `500`.\n- The responses will always be JSON and this information should be explicit in the HTTP response.\n- For each http `POST` request, your program should create the corresponding JSON file and store the contents of the body, and then provide the content as JSON in the HTTP response, if possible. If the file already exists, it should replace it.\n- If for any reason the server fails, the response should be an object with a key `error` and its value `server failed`.\n\n### Example\n\nTo test your program, you should be able to expect the following behaviour once your program is up and running.\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST localhost:5000/Ronaldinho -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"answer\": \"yes\", \"drink\": \"guarana\", \"food\": \"chicken stroganoff\"}'\n{\n  \"answer\": \"yes\",\n  \"drink\": \"guarana\",\n  \"food\": \"chicken stroganoff\"\n}\n```\n\n### Notions\n\n- [HTTP protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)\n- [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n- [Node http package: createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener)\n- [How `fetch` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)\n\n### Provided files\n\nDownload [`guests.zip`](../tell-me-how-many/resources/guests.zip) to have at your disposal the `guests` directory containing the files with the guests information.

      "full_content": "## wget\n\n### Objectives\n\nThis project objective consists on recreating some functionalities of [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) using a compiled language of your choice (like C, Rust, Go or other).\n\nThese functionalities will consist in:\n\n- The normal usage of `wget`: downloading a file given an URL, example: `wget https://some_url.ogr/file.zip`\n- Downloading a single file and saving it under a different name\n- Downloading and saving the file in a specific directory\n- Set the download speed, limiting the rate speed of a download\n- Downloading a file in background\n- Downloading multiple files at the same time, by reading a file containing multiple download links asynchronously\n- Main feature will be to download an entire website, [mirroring a website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site)\n\n### Introduction\n\nWget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.\n\nTo see more about wget you can visit the manual by using the command `man wget`, or you can visit the website [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).\n\n#### Usage\n\nYour program must have as arguments the link from where you want to download the file, for instance:\n\n```console\n$ go run . https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\n```\n\nThe program should be able to give feedback, displaying the:\n\n- Time that the program started: it must have the following format **yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss**\n- Status of the request. For the program to proceed to the download, it must present a response to the request as status OK (`200 OK`) if not, it should say which status it got and finish the operation with an error warning\n- Size of the content downloaded: the content length can be presented as raw (bytes) and rounded to Mb or Gb depending on the size of the file downloaded\n- Name and path of the file that is about to be saved\n- A progress bar, having the following:\n  - A amount of `KiB` or `MiB` (depending on the download size) that was downloaded\n  - A percentage of how much was downloaded\n  - Time that remains to finish the download\n- Time that the download finished respecting the previous format\n\nIt should look something like this\n\n```console\n$ go run . https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\nstart at 2017-10-14 03:46:06\nsending request, awaiting response... status 200 OK\ncontent size: 56370 [~0.06MB]\nsaving file to: ./EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\n 55.05 KiB / 55.05 KiB [================================================================================================================] 100.00% 1.24 MiB/s 0s\n\nDownloaded [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg]\nfinished at 2017-10-14 03:46:07\n```\n\n#### Flags\n\nYour program should be able to handle different flags.\n\n1. The flag `-B` should be handled, this flag should download a file immediately to the background and the output should be redirected to a log file. When the program containing this flag is executed it should output : `Output will be written to \"wget-log\"`. Example:\n\n```console\n$ go run . -B https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\nOutput will be written to \"wget-log\".\n$ cat wget-log\nstart at 2017-10-14 03:46:06\nsending request, awaiting response... status 200 OK\ncontent size: 56370 [~0.06MB]\nsaving file to: ./EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\nDownloaded [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg]\nfinished at 2017-10-14 03:46:07\n$\n```\n\n2. Download a file and save it under a different name by using the flag `-O` followed by the name you wish to save the file, example:\n\n```console\n$ go run . -O=meme.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\nstart at 2017-10-14 03:46:06\nsending request, awaiting response... status 200 OK\ncontent size: 56370 [~0.06MB]\nsaving file to: ./meme.jpg\n 55.05 KiB / 55.05 KiB [================================================================================================================] 100.00% 1.24 MiB/s 0s\n\nDownloaded [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg]\nfinished at 2017-10-14 03:46:07\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 student student 56370 ago 13 16:59 meme.jpg\n-rw-r--r-- 1 student student 11489 ago 13 10:28 main.go\n```\n\n---\n\n3. It should also handle the path to where your file is going to be saved using the flag `-P` followed by the path to where you want to save the file, example:\n\n```console\n$ go run . -P=~/Downloads/ -O=meme.jpg https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\nstart at 2017-10-14 03:46:06\nsending request, awaiting response... status 200 OK\ncontent size: 56370 [~0.06MB]\nsaving file to: ~/Downloads/meme.jpg\n 55.05 KiB / 55.05 KiB [================================================================================================================] 100.00% 1.24 MiB/s 0s\n\nDownloaded [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg]\nfinished at 2017-10-14 03:46:07\n$ ls -l ~/Downloads/meme.jpg\n-rw-r--r-- 1 student student 56370 ago 13 16:59 /home/student/Downloads/meme.jpg\n```\n\n---\n\n4. The program should handle speed limit. Basically the program can control the speed of the download by using the flag `--rate-limit`. If you download a huge file you can limit the speed of your download, preventing the program from using the full possible bandwidth of your connection, example:\n\n```console\n$ go run . --rate-limit=400k https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMtmPFLWkAA8CIS.jpg\n```\n\nThis flag should accept different value types, example: k and M. So you can put the rate limit as `rate-limit=200k` or `rate-limit=2M`\n\n---\n\n5. Downloading different files should be possible. For this the program will receive the `-i` flag followed by a file name that will contain all links that are to be downloaded. Example:\n\n```console\n$ ls\ndownload.txt   main.go\n$ cat download.txt\nhttps://assets.01-edu.org/wgetDataSamples/20MB.zip\nhttps://assets.01-edu.org/wgetDataSamples/Image_10MB.zip\n$ go run . -i=download.txt\ncontent size: [10485760, 20971520]\nfinished 10MB.zip\nfinished 20MB.zip\n\nDownload finished:  [https://assets.01-edu.org/wgetDataSamples/20MB.zip https://assets.01-edu.org/wgetDataSamples/Image_10MB.zip]\n\n```\n\nThe Downloads should work asynchronously, it should download both files at the same time. You are free to display what you want for this option.\n\n---\n\n6. [**Mirror a website**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_site). This option should download the entire website being possible to use \"part\" of the website offline and for other useful [reasons](https://www.quora.com/How-exactly-does-Mirror-Site-works-and-how-it-is-done). For this you will have to download the website file system and save it into a folder that will have the domain name. Example: `http://www.example.com`, will be stored in a folder with the name `www.example.com` containing every file from the mirrored website. The flag should be `--mirror`.\n\nThe default usage of the flag will be to retrieve and parse the HTML or CSS from the given URL. This way retrieving the files that the document refers through tags. The tags that will be used for this retrieval must be `a`, `link` and `img` that contains attributes `href` and `src`.\n\nYou will have to implement some optional flags to go along with the `--mirror` flag.\n\nThose flags will work based on [Follow links](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Following-Links). The command `wget` has several mechanisms that allows you to fine-tune which links it will follow. For This project you will have to implement the behavior of (note that this flags will be used in conjunction with the `--mirror` flag):\n\n- [Types of Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Types-of-Files) (`--reject` short hand `-R`)\n\n> this flag will have a list of file suffixes that the program will avoid downloading during the retrieval\n\nexample:\n\n```console\n$ go run . --mirror -R=jpg,gif https://example.com\n```\n\n- [Directory-Based Limits](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Directory_002dBased-Limits) (`--exclude` short hand -X)\n\n> this flag will have a list of paths that the program will avoid to follow and retrieve. So if the URL is `https://example.com` and the directories are `/js`, `/css` and `/assets` you can avoid any path by using `-X=/js,/assets`. The fs will now just have `/css`.\n\nexample:\n\n```console\n$ go run . --mirror -X=/assets,/css https://example.com\n```\n\n- [Convert Links for Offline Viewing](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#The-%60--convert_002dlinks%60-Option) (`--convert-links`)\n\n> this flag will convert the links in the downloaded files so that they can be viewed offline, changing them to point to the locally downloaded resources instead of the original URLs.\n\nexample:\n\n```console\n$ go run . --mirror --convert-links https://example.com\n```\n\n### Hint\n\nYou can take a look into the [html package](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html) for some help.\\\nTry the real flags from the wget command to better understand their usage.\n\n---\n\nThis project will help you learn about:\n\n- [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html)\n- HTTP\n- [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol)\n- Algorithms (recursion)\n- Mirror websites\n  - Follow links\n- File system (fs)\n",

This will gives us\neven more freedom to build our own logic.\n\n### Declaring a function\n\nWe mentioned before that a function had to be either assigned to a variable or\nan object property.\n\nWe will now declare one in a variable. Let's call it: `myFirstFunction`.\n\nOnce a variable is declared; Remember how an array can be recognized with this\nsyntax : `[]` ? or an object with this one : `{}` ?\n\nWell, we will use another syntax for declaring our function. We will do so using\nthe `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax : `() => {}`\n\n- So we first put parens `()`, These, are the containers of the `arguments` that\n  go in the function. For now we will leave them empty with no arguments. (More\n  on those later on)\n- We then add the arrow `=>` which is the distinguishing feature of the\n  `ArrowFunctionExpression` syntax.\n- Finally, we add the curly brackets `{}` to delimite the scope of our newly\n  created function. Note: They are not always necessary, you will probably find\n  examples of this function syntax without the `{}`. However, for now because\n  you are learning. We will put them most of the time.\n\n```js\n//    ↙ normal variable     ↙ beginning of the scope of the function\nlet myFirstFunction = () => {\n  //                    ↖ parens () for arguments and the arrow => for syntax\n} // <-end of the scope of the function\n```\n\nIt's now possible to call this function using the `()`, like any pre-declared\nfunction:\n\n```js\nmyFirstFunction() // nothing happens\n```\n\nThis function if called, does not do anything, since it doesn't contain any\ncode.\n\n### The scope of a function `{}`\n\nVery much like an `if` statement a function has a scope. The scope in between\nthe curly braces`{}` is where the action happens. Let's add something to the\nscope of our function.\n\n```js\nlet myFirstFunction = () => {\n  console.log('Calling my first function')\n  // ↖ some instructions to do when the function is called !\n}\n```\n\nNow the function if called, display the output the `console.log()`.\n\n```js\nmyFirstFunction() // \"Calling my first function\"\n```\n\nWe actually used a function and gave it this single instruction:\n\n- call another function `console.log()`.\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou are a robot made by a scientist called Rick and you want to know your\npurpose.\n\n- Declare a function named `ask` that log `'What is my purpose ?'` in the\n  console\n- Declare a function named `reply` that log `'You pass butter.'` in the console\n\nThen first call the `ask` then the `reply` once, in that order.\n",

You can easly\nspot them because we stick parens after their identifiers `()`.\n\nFor example, here's a **function call**:\n\n```js\n//       ↙ identifier, like variables\nconsole.log('Hello There !')\n//          ↖ open paren + argument + close paren\n```\n\n#### Function name (`identifier` or `property.key`)\n\nThe first things that appears in a function is the `identifier`, in fact, in JS,\nfunctions are values of type `function`. This means that in order to be used a\nfunction **must** be either assigned to:\n\n- a variable\n- or an object property\n\n#### Function calling\n\nFunctions **do** something, and they can **return a result**, a value.\n\n`console.log` does not return a value, but it will do something: make its\narguments appear in the console.\n\nTo `call` the function, in other word run it, we need too add `()`.\n\n```js\nconsole.log // function is not used, nothing happen\nconsole.log() // function was called ! an empty line appear in the console\nconsole.log(4) // function was called with 4 and it appears in the console\n```\n\n#### Function `arguments`\n\nSo in that last example, number `4` was the argument of the `console.log`\nfunction.\n\nA function will execute the same code on different arguments, making them\nflexible.\n\n> Sometimes, `arguments` are named `parameters`. We just like to use 10\n> different names for everything to sound _\"smart\"_.\n\nJS gives you plenty of readymade functions, for now we are going to focus on\n`Math` functions.\n\n#### function `return values`\n\nAll functions from the JS `Math` object do nothing other than compute a new\nvalue from its argument.\n\nFor example, the well named `Math.round` function will take a number as argument\nand returns the rounded value of this number.\n\nTo use return values, assign them to `variables`:\n\n```js\nlet roundedValue = Math.round(1.8) // Here we assign the result of the function call\nconsole.log(roundedValue) // 2\n```\n\nThe variable `roundedValue` value is the number `2`, the result of the function\ncall.\n\n#### Nested function calls\n\nIt is also possible to use the return value of a function directly without using\nan intermediary variable.\\\nFor example we could have written:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.round(3.2)) // double functions call !!!! woaaaa\n```\n\nHere we first call `Math.round(3.2)` which returns the number `3` and that will\nbe passed to `console.log` that will procede to display it.\n\n### Instructions\n\nWe have prepared a variable `num`. Just as a warm up, use this variable `num` as\n`argument` of some `Math` functions.\n\n- Declare a `rounded` variable of `num` rounded value.\n- Declare a `truncated` variable of `num` truncated value.\n\nOne of the necessary Math function is already used in the lessons examples\nbefore the instructions. Explore the link below to see which others functions\nthe Math object contains in order to find what you need to complete this\nexercise.\n\n### Notions\n\n- [Math](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/math)\n",

Let's call\nthis function `returnsFive`. The only new concept is the `return` keyword.

Well as mentioned before, the `return` also\nstops the function execution. So only the first `return` would matter. In fact\nthat means that anything after the `return` would not be executed. Example:\n\n```js\nlet returnsFive = () => {\n  return 5 // ONLY this return is executed. Everything else is ignored.\n  return 10 // not executed (useless)\n  return 'I am useless' // not executed either\n  console.log('I am also useless') // nor this one\n}\nlet ten = returnsFive() + returnsFive()\nconsole.log(ten) // 10\n//exactly the same result as the previous example\n```\n\nAs you may see, we get exactly the same result as the previous example.\n`returnsFive` only returns `5`. :)\n\n### Instructions\n\nAs Rick's robot, you now know your purpose. (Remember ? `'You pass butter.'`)\n\nDefine the function `passButter` that returns the string `'The butter'`.\n\n![robot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/489466992286498816/828181031991377930/butter-disapointed.png?width=717&height=241)\n",

It is about creating families/teams, surviving by eating food and collecting stones in order to level up. Each level has different requirements for a ritual, which makes the adventure more and more difficult for the AI players, which play on their own, without any help form their creator. The game is over once six members of one family/team reach the highest possible level (8).\n\n### Game presentation\n\n### The Game Parts\n\nHere are the different parts of the game:\n\n- The `server` contains the field, the resources, and manages the logic and timing of the game.\n\n- One or many `clients` will connect to the server and each will “pilot” one player. The players are spread over teams.\n\n- A `graphic client` that connects to the server and displays the field and what happens there.\n\n#### Geography\n\n- The game consists in managing an entire world and its population. That world, \"Minerth\" is geographically made of plains, there won't be any obstacles on it.\n\n- The world is spherical and the game board is represented as a map. So if a player leaves the board from the right, he will enter again from the left.\n\n### Resources\n\nThe place where we are contains many resources that can be used for your survival, what you have to do is just look for them and get them before other players do. Here you will find some stones and food that you will need if you want to survive and evolve.\n\n- These stones are of 6 different types:\n\n  - jade\n  - peridot\n  - amber\n  - amethyst\n  - garnet\n  - ammolite\n\n- These resources must be randomly generated by the server, despite being random, the generation must have some logical rules, for example:\n\n- You can't put all the stones in one square.\n- You can't put more than one food per square.\n- Only one stone of each type in a square. You can have up to 3 stones of different types in the same square.\n\nThese are just some examples of some rules. It's up to you to decide them, but be prepared to explain them to the auditors.\n\n### General Rules\n\n- Each player starts with 10 food and 0 stones.\n- Each player starts on level 1.\n- As you level up, your player sight improves.\n- You must eat to survive and not starve and die.\n- You must collect stones to level up.\n- To win the game you must have at least 6 players of your family/team at level 8.\n\n### Player\n\n- The local is happy just looking for stones and feeding on the way, but don't be fooled by him, he can get greedy and kick you out of his way!\n\n- He meets, without issues, other people on the same location and sees as far as the eye can see.\n\n- It is impossible to guess the Minerthian orientation when crossing him.\n\n- The food that the Minerthian picks up is the only resource he needs to live.\n\n- One food unit allows him to survive 126 time units, so 126/t seconds. The more he picks up the more he lives.\n\n### Evolution ritual\n\n- The goal for everyone is to reach the top of the Minerthian hierarchy.\n\n- The ritual that allows you to increase the Minerthian physical and mental capacities must be performed as follows:\n\n  You need to gather in the same field unit (square):\n\n  - A specific set of stones.\n  - A specific number of players of the same level.\n\n- The player will start the enchantment and the evolution will start.\n- It is not necessary that all the players are on the same team, but they need to have the same levels.\n- All players participating in the enchantment will reach a higher level.\n- Only one player starts the enchantment and the others go to him and join.\n- Only after two or more players are on the same square, they can start the enchantment.\n- If one of the members dies, the others will continue the enchantment, unless the player is left alone, if that happens he has to start the process of enchantment again.\n\nHere are the combinations of resources and players you need for the enchantment and evolution:\n\n| Level | Number of Players | jade | peridot | amber | amethyst | garnet | ammolite |\n| :---: | :---------------: | :--: | :-----: | :---: | :------: | :----: | :------: |\n|  1-2  |         1         |  1   |    0    |   0   |    0     |   0    |    0     |\n|  2-3  |         2         |  1   |    1    |   1   |    0     |   0    |    0     |\n|  3-4  |         2         |  2   |    0    |   1   |    0     |   2    |    0     |\n|  4-5  |         4         |  1   |    1    |   2   |    0     |   1    |    0     |\n|  5-6  |         4         |  1   |    2    |   1   |    3     |   0    |    0     |\n|  6-7  |         6         |  1   |    2    |   3   |    0     |   1    |    0     |\n|  7-8  |         6         |  2   |    2    |   2   |    2     |   2    |    1     |\n\n### Vision\n\n- The player's view of the field is limited! In order to improve your vision you will have to level up.\n\nWith each evolution, your vision goes up one unit of measurement ahead and one on either side of a new line.\n\nHere is the example for the first 3 levels (our player is at 0):\n\n```console\n\n              ---- ---- ----\n             | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n              ---- ---- ----\n                  | 0  |\n                   ----\n                  Level 1\n\n         ---- ---- ---- ---- ----\n        | 4  |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |\n         ---- ---- ---- ---- ----\n             | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n              ---- ---- ----\n                  | 0  |\n                   ----\n                  Level 2\n\n ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n|  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |\n ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n      |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |\n       ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n             | 1  | 2  | 3  |\n              ---- ---- ----\n                  | 0  |\n                   ----\n                  Level 3\n\n```\n\nFor the player to know what's around him, the `client` sends the command `SEE` and the server responds the following chain of characters (for level 1):\n\n```console\n{content-square-0, content-square-1, content-square-2, content-square-3}\n```\n\nOur player cannot see himself and if there is more than 1 object in a square, they are all indicated and separated by a space:\n\n```console\n              -------- -------- --------\n             | amber  | garnet |        |\n             | player | garnet |        |\n              -------- -------- --------\n                      |        |\n                      |  food  |\n                       --------\n                        Level 1\n\n```\n\n```console\n{food, player amber, garnet garnet, }\n```\n\n### The Time and Game Speed\n\nThe game speed is defined by a time unit. Each action in the game has a duration proportionate to this time unit.\n\nThe time unit is defined by the function 1/t :\n\n- t is passed as parameter at the start of the server.\n- A time unit lasts 1/t seconds.\n- The Minerthians have second as an absolute time unit.\n- The formula for the execution of an action is `action/t`.\n- `t` is an integer. If `t=1` \"advance\" takes 7 seconds. We choose by default, `t=100` then \"advance\" will take 7/100 seconds.\n\n### Objects Management\n\nIt is impossible to distinguish two objects of the same class. Only the class of an object can be identifiable, that is, two 'ambers' will have the same denomination, as they belong to the same class, but 'garnet' will have a different class than 'ambers', that way you are able to identify the resources.\n\n### Teams/Families\n\nThe goal of the game is to create a `team/family` of six players and get them to level 8!\n\nAt the beginning of the game your family only has one member, so you have to complete the action of `calling` in order to get more family members.\n\nEach player starts with 10 food and is controlled by a `client`. The `clients` cannot communicate or exchange amongst each other data outside of the game, in any way.\n\n### Calling\n\nThe execution of the `fork` command results in a `ship` being called. Your player will call another member of his family.\n\nOnce the call has been made, the player can proceed with his life while waiting for the \"ship\" to arrive. When the `ship` arrives, a new player will appear and will receive a random direction. This operation allows a new player to join.\n\nThe `connect_nbr` command sends back the number of connections that are underway and authorized for\nthis family. This way you will also know how many spots you have free on you team/family.\n\n- Time to call the ship: 48/t\n\n- Time for the ship to arrive 600/t\n\n### Inventory\n\nThe `inventory` command allows you to see what objects the player has and how much time he has left. The server will send back, for example, the following line:\n\n```\n{food 300, amber 4, garnet 7, ..., peridot 2}\n```\n\n### Kick\n\nA player can kick all the players sharing the same square. It pushes them in the direction he is looking at. When a `client` sends the `kick` command to the server, all the `clients` in that square receive the following line:\n\n```\nmoving <K>\\n\n```\n\nWith K indicating the direction the player is looking to, which is where the other players will be kicked. The kick only works for players, you can't kick food or other resources and you can't kick during the evolution ritual.\n\n### The commands\n\nHere are the actions that a player will respond to and their syntax. Remember that the syntax must be the same as the following:\n\n|                      Action                       |      Command      | Delay/time |         Response         |\n| :-----------------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------: | :----------------------: |\n|                advance one square                 |      advance      |    7/t     |            ok            |\n|               turn right 90 degrees               |       right       |    7/t     |            ok            |\n|               turn left 90 degrees                |       left        |    7/t     |            ok            |\n|                        see                        |        see        |    7/t     | {square1, square2, ...}  |\n|                     inventory                     |     inventory     |    1/t     | {garnet n, amber n, ...} |\n|                  pick an object                   |  pick \\<object>   |    7/t     |          ok/ko           |\n|                  drop an object                   |  drop \\<object>   |    7/t     |          ok/ko           |\n|           kick a player from the square           |       kick        |    7/t     |          ok/ko           |\n|                     broadcast                     | broadcast \\<text> |    7/t     |            ok            |\n|               begin the enchantment               |    enchantment    |   300/t    |  evolution in progress   |\n|                                                   |                   |            |    current level : K     |\n|                   fork a player                   |       fork        |    48/t    |            ok            |\n| know the number of unused connections by the team |    connect_nbr    |    0/t     |          value           |\n|                 death of a player                 |         -         |     -      |          death           |\n\nAll commands are passed as a character string that ends with a newline.\nIn case of any unknown or incorrect command, the server must respond with \"ko\".\n\n### Broadcast\n\nTo send a message, the following command must be sent to the server by the client:\n\n```\nbroadcast <text>\n```\n\nThe server will send this line to all its clients:\n\n```\nmessage <K>,<text>\n```\n\nWith K indicating the direction from where the sound comes.\n\n### Sound Transmission\n\nAll the players listen to the broadcasts without knowing who broadcasts them, what they understand from it, is only the direction from which the sound comes and the message.\n\nThe number of squares traversed by the sound before reaching the player indicates its direction.\nThis numbering is done by assigning '1' to the square in front of the player, then counting down the squares around the player in a trigonometric (counterclockwise) direction.\nRemember, sound is a wave that moves in a linear manner and the world is round, so we'll choose the shortest path for sound between the transmitter and the player we calculated for.\n\nThe following example indicates the sound trajectory that we must choose, as well as the numbers of the squares around the player. The player \"A\" is the source that sends the broadcast through the square 4 and \"B\" is the receptor witch receives the broadcast through square 2.\n\n![Example](./sound.png)\n\nIf the broadcast is sent from the same box as the receiving player, he will receive the message from square 0.\n\n### The Server\n\nThe server is the main engine that will interfere between the AI and the GUI. It will exchange all data with the AI and execute these instructions. At the same time, it send the information to the GUI. It can be written in one of these languages [C, C++, Rust].\n\nFor this part, you must create a TCP server to make a connection between clients and manage the entire world. There is no need to host the server as the game will run in one machine only, a localhost will be enough for now.\n\n#### Server Instructions\n\n- Your server must generate all the resources in a random way following the rules mentioned above in the resources section.\n- Any request to your server must never hang forever. It must never block, and the `client` can be appropriately bounced if necessary.\n- The server executes the `client` requests in the order they are received.\n- The requests are buffered and the execution time of the command will only block the player concerned.\n- It's forbidden to use any `exec` functions to run another server.\n- It must stay available at all costs.\n\n> Use multiplexing connections on your server.\n\n```console\n$ ./server\n\tUsage: ./server -p <port> -x <width> -y <height> n <team> [<team>] [<team>] ... -c <nb> [-t <t>]\n    -p  is the port number\n    -x  is the width of the world\n    -y  is the height of the world\n    -n  is the name of the teams\n    -c  is the number of authorized clients per team\n    -t  is the time unit divider (the greater t is, the faster the game will go)\n```\n\n**Tip**\n\n- You can implement a non-blocking architecture with a circular buffer for every player action, allowing the data to be stored while performing the actions. The approach you take is up to you to decide.\n\n### The Client\n\nThe Client can be written in a language of your choice.\n\n```console\n$./client\nUsage: ./client -n <team> -p <port> [-h <hostname>]\n  -n is the name of the team\n  -p is the port number\n  -h is the name of the host, the default is localhost\n```\n\nThe client is autonomous, he must send the command order to the server without any intervention from humans.\n\n### Client/server communication\n\nThe communication between client and server will happen via sockets and TCP. The port used must be indicated in the programs parameters.\n\nThe client will send its requests without waiting for their execution, and the server sends back a message confirming the successful execution of the requests.\n\nThe `client` will open a socket on the server's port and the connection `client` to `server` will happen as such:\n\n| Client's message |   Command   |\n| :--------------: | :---------: |\n|                  |  WELCOME\\n  |\n|   team-name\\n    |             |\n|                  | nb-client\\n |\n|                  |    x y\\n    |\n\nThe `nb-client` indicates the number of clients that can still be accepted by the server for the team `team-name`. If that number is greater than 1 a new client connects. `X` and `Y` indicate the world’s dimensions.\n\nIf the team name passed by the client doesn't exist the server must print `\"Error: the team <name of team> doesn't exist\"`\n\n> The client can send up to 10 successful requests without a response from the server. More than 10, the server will no longer take them into account.\n\nThere is no chat room or sharing of data between players. Still, the Player can broadcast a message through a command-line sent to the server, which will be broadcasted to all players; All details are in the sound transmission part.\n\n### Graphic interface\n\nTo have a better vision of the game, which is simple, clear and ergonomic, the project will need to have a graphic visualization client. That client will propose a real-time representation of the world as it is on the server.\n\n- Using any game Engine is forbidden!\n- The interface must be at least in 2D with the use of icons allowing a representation of the world.\n- You need to make sure you can see the in-game items.\n- You need to implement the ability to click on a square to see its details, such as how many items of each are inside the square. It should look like a floating window, tooltip or something else.\n- You need to make sure that the visualization of sounds is included.\n\nThe graphic part can be developed in a language of your choice [Javascript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Perl, etc]. This will communicate within the network with the `server` to retrieve the contents of the `map, teams, inventories, etc`, everything that is needed to see what is happening in the game.\n\n### BONUS\n\n- Create a 3D interface or any other type of representation.\n- Add a flag to for a log mode when running the server.\n- Add a flag for the number of resources and food density (could be different levels for example).\n- Implement a seed in the server and client so that specific scenarios could be reproduced.\n\n> Attention: `siege` is a stressing tool, use it ONLY to test your own server. Do **NEVER** use it on any server/website without the owner's permission. If you do so you would have illegally DDoSed a server and could face serious troubles.\n",
